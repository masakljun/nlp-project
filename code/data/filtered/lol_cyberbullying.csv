2;86; I hope 0aba20f58e4a5c32 gets banned so she stops trolling/streaming. 
2;105; Quote: 59d9c14e8d42af91: Oh, and every team sport, the players would constantly talk in All Caps, because they're yelling at each other the entire time. Spoken like a fat kid that never even made the team. 
2;134; Quote: 8f2426df840df8f1: You need to stop using the word homophobia. Nobody's scared of anybody. The alleged-offensive terms do not indicate fear. I'm tired of this stupid term. I can dislike gay people and homosexual behavior (and I do) by simple moral conviction if I want. Hell, it might just be my choice because I get mad and want to dislike something. That doesn't mean I'm afraid of it. Saying that you're homophobic is a nice way of saying that you're a bigot, just fyi. Would you rather be called a homophobe or a bigot? Why have an irrational dislike of a certain group of people that has absolutely no effect on you in any way possible?

2;318; 84f2e6beea4d5568 playing annie is trying not to win the game either by losing lane and baiting teammates into places where she goes afk.mf, me went 10/0 in lane then end the game losing at 15/6 because of his trolling.This player just threw my already won ranked game on purpose these are the texts he sent after the game was over.84f2e6beea4d5568: i love how this ends up7622b9d42022e4a2: more like you were handed the game by annie84f2e6beea4d5568: mf doesnt deserve to win seriously7622b9d42022e4a2: but ok84f2e6beea4d5568: hahahah84f2e6beea4d5568: mf thought she was the ****84f2e6beea4d5568: leaving team fights84f2e6beea4d5568: YOU DESEVE THIS U ******* ARROGANT *****84f2e6beea4d5568: I AM ****IN LOVING THIS ****84f2e6beea4d5568: I WOULD DO IT 1000 TIMES OVER 
2;364; Quote: c8e0f76fdd290657: In response to the feeding issue. alot of people are doing it on purpose to prove a point that riot does not address (probably because you would have no high ranked players XD). I can only speak for myself, but if a guy is a total @sshole to me, I will feed intentionally. If they can get away with calling me names like *** or say your retarded, then that is so much more serious than feeding, that's harassment, sometimes sexual harassment. you want people to stop feeding, then address your overpopulated Jerk players. Condoning this kind of behavior is borderline criminal and to allow it to continue is worse. Fix it! You're as toxic as anybody I ever met and I hope you are banned permanently. If you can't handle people, don't play team games. It's not hard to mute people that are being ugly, and the report feature is there. One person you don't like is no excuse for you to intentionally ruin 3 other people's game. Banning you is the first fix to banning jerk players. 
2;430; Quote: cfe60035e77b11d5: The bans that have come without warnings and have been permanent or 14 day were all reviewed by a person. You have no idea what you're talking about, which makes it funny to everybody who does. You think it's this big, sad, horrible thing, and honestly everybody is happy you're gone. For the past 8 hours I've had 0 ragers, 0 abusers, 1 AFK (in ascension) and 1 inappropriate language (racism). It's wonderful. It's like Riot is blowing rainbows out of their servers. Stay banned. Better yet, get real mad and say or do something stupid and get perma'd. This is nice! By your comment, you're being a toxic player yourself. You're trying to basically say that everyone on League of Legends hates me while you just met me an hour ago on this post. You're also encouraging someone to break the rules which is very toxic. You do not know me in real life nor in League of Legends. People usually honor me and I'm always warding, putting pings, and helping other people push their lanes. If my teammate makes a mistake, I don't harass him like a Dou***. I go and help him or tell him what to do if I'm busy pushing. When I have my jungler help me, I always thank him, even if we didn't get to kill enemy because he's helping me even though he doesn't have to if he wants. From what I can tell on your comment, is that you're a guy who is always rages and verbally assaults people in games. If anyone should be banned, it should be you. 
2;438;To the people replying to this uber troll, cfe60035e77b11d5, just stop. Don't feed the troll anymore. He obviously has no idea what he's talking about. Since he still believes the bans were reviewed by a person, he obviously didn't even read @8e65b082c4262407's post well enough to know that there are no people managing the tribunal, but instead an automated system algorithm that records data based on match history and player reports. He doesn't seem to understand that there is no actual investigation into the reports or the chat logs of the said match(s) in question. This guy has been trolling this thread for a while now so I believe he just enjoys getting on people nerves when he has no clue what's going on because he doesn't give a sh** about it since he hasn't been banned yet. Which, with his horrible attitude towards others on GD, I'm surprised he hasn't been reported in-game and banned. This kid is just one of those who likes to aggravate people because he thinks he's perfect and has never done anything wrong in LoL but I guarantee you he has probably been more toxic, and talked more sh** to the people in-game in his matches and in the lobby's than most of the people posting right now. He's just a f*cking troll kid who has yet to get banned. But just watch, when he does get banned, and believe me he WILL get banned, he'll come running right back to 8e65b082c4262407 *****ing about how he got banned for nothing, and with no evidence to prove it. But the difference, judging by his attitude on GD, he'll be one of the people that got banned for a good reason.
2;442; Quote: cfe60035e77b11d5: You guys have done nothing but complain and cry. It's a conspiracy, it's unfair, it's BS, it's someone else's fault. I've been banned for bad behavior before, I shut up and did something else 'cuz I knew it was my fault. You guys do the opposite. It's this kind of excuses, bad behavior, and justifying **** that got you to where you are in the first place. No what got a lot of us here are the trolls like you who do nothing but instigate conflicts with people and then report them because they got so fed up with your bullsh*t that they finally went off on you, all the while you keep acting like you're the innocent victim trying to act as though you didn't do anything to instigate such behavior and we're all the toxic ones for telling you off because you're being a rude little troll intentionally trying to get on everyone's nerves. 
2;443;There are 3 reasons why u should just leave cfe60035e77b11d5: 1. Everyone here thinks u shoulda got banned. 2. You should be banned. 3. U are proof that the system is broken because ifanyone here should be perm banned its u.
2;458; Quote: cfe60035e77b11d5: What's really funny is that no matter what, you can't stop underscoring that your behavior isn't your responsibility. Support owes you an explanation of your terrible behavior (that you minimize as bad gamesquot , the ban is b/c of pricks who caused us to have those bad games, your behavior here is b/c of pricks...gee, no matter where you go, you can't seem to get away from people who make you a toxic, abusive person! Don't look in a mirror or anything. Just keep pointing fingers. Stop acting like a hypocrite and look at yourself in the mirror. All you've done in this thread is try to put down players and calling them idiots. You're the very thing you say you despise. I've gotten a 14 day ban when I barely talk and just focus on playing the game and having fun. I usually have wins, but there are toxic players such as yourself, who demoralize the entire team and probably end up going afk/feeding. So if anyone should look in a mirror, it should be you.

Honestly telling you to take responsibility for yourself, stop whining, and stop blaming others isn't calling anyone idiots. If telling you that you have serious problem with your behavior doesn't mean anything from me, take it from Riot. Their 14 day ban is a pretty big hint. But then, if you want to ignore the writing on the wall, you're already well on your way to a permaban. Good luck finding someone else to blame.

You're the only one who has a serious problem with their behavior since you're straight up insulting everyone who got banned. I never even get toxic players anymore which is why I have so many victories. I can tell you are toxic when you have only 10 friend/helpful honors.

Kid, when the f*ck are you just gonna stop, and go away? You are SERIOUSLY the exact type of little SH*T that pisses people off on purpose and then reports them for telling you to f*ck off and stop trolling like a 5 year old. How long are you gonna sit around and intentionally piss people off? How the hell have you not been banned from GD yet? It's the sad garbage like this that gets on peoples nerves. It's because little jerkoffs like you get away with this kind of trash talk to people who didn't do anything to you in the first place. It's this ridiculous, overrated system that lets punks like you get away with this sh*t while the rest of us get punished for telling you to F*CK OFF.

This kid is just here to troll everyone like the child he is. Everyone he's talked sh*t to has pretty much told him to go f*ck himself and quit trolling the thread but he doesn't seem to understand that the more he trolls us, the more he fuels our argument - that it's the players like him that really deserve to be banned the most for intentionally instigating rash behavior from the rest of the players. Players who are just trying to have a few decent matches without some little punks running their mouths off because they have attention issues.This kid has been at it for days. He's been harassing so many people about their posts. But honestly, I hope he keeps it up. Because the more he talks his generic bullsh*t and keeps on trolling the other players' posts and intentionally trying instigate more arguments and harsh retaliation, the more he helps us out by showing Riot how 1-sided and flawed their new system is. Because if they let him get away with acting like this on the forums, how many people are still getting away with it in-game? Because they obviously aren't doing their job thoroughly enough, neither in-game nor elsewhere.

We have the right to express our anger as long as it doesn't cause somebody to commit suicide. edit: What is wrong with saying somebody is bad? In every game I've played since I was 9 until now people have called me bad regardless of whether I was or not. I am majorly competitive and with school and life I don't have the time nor money to play sports to get that sort of thing out. There are people who swear and cuss at their TVs for sports games and people see that as a normal cultural act. Why is getting mad for wanting to win a game and frustrated a bad thing. This guy is a troll like the rest of the LoL community. He's not about solutions. He just wants to be the masterdebater and cause conflict.

Fuck you.Summoner opens with Locket for a proactive defense.Jarvan drops a new Demacian Standard to maintain the speed boost before it expires next turn; this allows us to keep the highest speed and attack first. Dragon Strike Pallas again and end with Martial Cadence.Darius continues his triple Decimate wild spinning at medium range from Pallas. We could dunk him, but triple decimate does more damage and we already ensure his stun this turn, effectively wasting the potential stun proc from the dunk. Save the dunk for an emergency reactive stun if necessary.Nami uses Tidal Wave on Pallas, hitting Jax and all party members in its path, excluding the Summoner whose current position has him out of its path. This wave also deliberately misses Vel'Koz, provided his current position, in order to avoid provoking him.Jax is immune to auto-attack effects currently, so simply use Equilibrium stike to deny him 2 action points. Save the remaining 2 action points to attempt additional equilibrium strikes on Jax if his tenacity prevents the stun.The combined tidal wave and equilibrium strike should deny both Jax and Pallas another 3 action points, leaving them stunned next turn.While we can't guarantee that Jax remains stunned, it is imperative that we keep Pallas locked down to prevent him from stealing any more attack.Estimation of current layout:985594 985607985608985613 985610 985615985609 985611 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_idAE0IGqc ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_idAE0IGqc) "

73;163; i joined GD using one of my many refer-a-friend fraud smurfs, aptly named a648affc601dc39f. I laughed at a lot of ****posters and trolls like 6eebbb99664c7a4e and 04118b733c145c72. I found it funny that they continued to post even when everyone ****ing hated them. So I started ****posting and apparently people thought I was 6eebbb99664c7a4e. I remember I began posting when a few people were stirring up the ****storm about Lux being OP around the end of season 2/beginning of season 3, and I started spamming Lux OP ****.time really passed. it seems like I joined not too long ago and now apparently everyone is preaching judgement day. I've ****posted, normal posted, posted advice, posted story threads, troll threads, **** threads, bait, you name it. it was a blast GD, it's a shame I never got to play with/friend any of you except a few. 
73;204; Screw it, more confessions.I actually really liked fe1ec6dfea574d36 before he changed to being the super nice guy. It feels really polarizing. I know 25f1c66612874910 and those bunch hated him but I never had a problem.Which reminds me, I used to think c30e3ed972c2de3f was an utter dicklord cause of that. Especially since he went on a crusade against him, which is something I really dislike when people do.Oh, I also remember being in the Fekking Chatroom for a long time. It used to be actually used until the whole Drama with fe1ec6dfea574d36 and c30e3ed972c2de3f went down, and then everyone switched to another one that is now basically dead but people are still in.1ee90a8b33a20f9a rustles my jimmies inherently.25f1c66612874910 and d6210de57bce4a8d are my two favorite people I know from GD. I feel like d6210de57bce4a8d just ignores me now though. RIP friendship.I'm actually a bit toxic, but have never been banned for it. However, I have been banned something like 15 times for leaving games. That also got me the nickname Raleave.Lastly, ea2a82b2ae236a88's a fgt

140;525; Quote: c3930062e45967af: Your high level point here is dead on. Our thinking here was that damage to champions on Twin Fang coupled with the stack building mechanics would have incentivized and rewarded champion interaction-- making sure Cassiopeia still wanted to interact with enemy champions was a very important goal in this rework. As I said, we may have missed the tuning a bit on the mana, so if this turns out to be the case, I think we can solve your concerns with some number changes. Interacting with champions was already incentivized and rewarded. Look I get that you're in love with your ****ing stupid stacking passive, but you are seriously just arrogantly blowing **** out your ass and disrespecting Cassiopeia players here. Sorry if you don't like my tone, but I have lost my patience with your useless responses. Numbers cannot fix this rework. Not doing this rework fixes this rework. You don't seem to be getting that the entire thing is flawed, and are instead smugly trotting out Maybe you're just not good enough to know how to play her now.

Could you have imagined the same outcome with the new Cass? Definitely not, especially considering the pace of that game. On a competitive level the early and midgame are insanely important, if you're unable to contribute during those phases of the game you're pretty throwing the match if your teammates fail to compensate for your shortcomings. Yeah what makes it even worse is that d8720f83aa12db6b or some other dumb Riot person is going to come in and say See, she needed nerfs because she was used once. There's no way to win here. They've made up their minds and won't be dissuaded from their stupid decisions. 
140;799; RIP Cassiopeia. I hope you're happy Idiot c3930062e45967af. 
140;1130;She's so garbage lol, like honestly why in the world would you pick a cheap version of Ryze and or Veigar when you can actually play those champions, get your powerspike around 15 minutes, and still have a better laning phase? I also like how this rework's ****ty designer keeps defending his garbage passive lol. What a pathetic excuse, how the **** did this idiot land a job at Riot? A Chimpanzee or Dolphin could of came up with a better rework then this.
140;1170; Quote: 1822e321da16845a: Its gotten to the point where, esp if you're behind and haven't been able to hit your absurd stack-goals, where you can't even reliably kill someone even AFTER you've ulted them. Maybe that'll change when they fix the E bug...but for some reason I'm not holding my breath -.- Edit: I don't even have the heart to tell my jungler how useless I'll be as a leash. Like...before sometimes I wouldn't leash b/c I wanna be first in lane and get that early lvl 2 advantage. Now? My AA's are a more effective source of damage than my Q's. Also, question, but why would I lvl up Q first any longer, given it's a tricky skill shot to land whose purpose, since its dmg has been gutted, early game is solely for racking-up stacks for her passive, instead of W? W is more reliable, since it leaves an AoE effect behind that also slows, and sticks around for 7 seconds, and since the dmg it applies is negligible, stupider opponents usually don't have a problem going in while CSing. It causes multiple minons to be poisoned, which makes getting stacks on killing them easier. The mana costs is 40, just like Q, but it's also on a longer CD, which means I won't make the mistake of spamming it trying to poison more nimble opponents. Gahhh! How about level your E... That is what riot intended... W the wave, E everything for mana and stacks.. Why would you max Q? are you an idiot? Read the changes.. 
140;1529; I don't know about the rest of you, but if this is the rate they are working on Cassiopeia, she'll be in a good spot in about 2 months.Thanks Idiot c3930062e45967af, 2 months my favorite champion is not playable. 
140;1533; Things I would change about current Cassiopeia:Aspect of the SerpentBonuses applied on 75/200/300 stacksHitting multiple champions gives multiple stacksThoughts: Essentially waiting 40 minutes on average to get fully buffed is a ridiculous amount of time considering you have had no impact in early game. Midgame should be where you start gaining power. Reducing the final boost to 300 stacks allows you to get it at around 30 minutes, however if you are actively participating in team fights (it's a team game after all) you will now gain stacks even quicker by hitting multiple enemy champions.Noxious BlastAP ratio increased to 0.8Mana cost increased to 55/60/65/70/75Thoughts: The damage was fine before, so the ratio was reverted to pre-rework. The mana cost has been INCREASED for every rank EXCEPT rank 5. This prevents early game abuse however when she starts approaching mid levels she will be able to spam them just as before. Mana costs may need to be reduced eventually because she no longer has a passive reducing the cost.Also the damage increase greatly helps with farming, having one ability to farm minions is not fun, this will make it much easier to get stacks. See twin fang thoughts for more on this.MiasmaNo changes, miasma is more of a panic poison and a minor CC ability. The increase in slow in exchange for damage seems fair. The utility of this ability (slow, poison status, vision in bushes) should be what you are using it for not damage.Twin FangDamage increased to 55/90/125/160/195Cooldown reduced to 0.5 if target is poisoned.Thoughts: Why would you nerf the ability that you are trying to make her main ability? Doesn't make sense in any way and a .5 increase in AP ratio doesn't make up for it at all.I was considering changing twin fang to reset its cooldown when you kill a target with it, but with the increase of damage on Noxious Blast you no longer need to rely so heavily on this skill as your only farming skill. You should be more focused now on the mana refund from this ability then having to meticulously making sure your target is poisoned before last hitting them.Fix the cooldown reset Idiot c3930062e45967af.Petrifying GazeDamage increased to 200/325/450AP ratio increased to 0.6Reverted all changes except mana cost. Seriously Idiot c3930062e45967af, why would you nerf her Ultimate? It's not even that great compared to other champions. It's Cassiopeia's ULTIMATE skill, it should do damage. It's not a CC utility. It's an ULTIMATE. Seriously there must be something wrong with you. 
140;1591;Lol you guys are still trying, they don't give 2 ****s about us Cassiopeia players and c3930062e45967af can go to hell for all I care. Ruining a perfectly fine and unique champion and defending her while her playerbase and many statistics (****ty winrate) say she's throw up. This company is a joke, LUCKILY THE MASTER CHIEF COLLECTION COMES OUT SOON.
140;1605; I honestly wish they would just fire c3930062e45967af and his career in anything video game related is tarnished for life. Go find a new career. Because you clearly don't care about anybody but yourself. You've only been in it for yourself. Hence you ignored the community and fed us a load of bull. Because you don't care. You're just staving us off and trying to impress your co-workers and supervisors.Edit: Never disliked anyone this much before, and c3930062e45967af is a complete stranger to me. 
140;1812; Quote: 1284a919fb514e64: Riot has addressed this before. The response was basically, Different Rioters do things differently. OK so our answer is basically that ed65fb489caa9674 is a stand up guy who cares about riot's players, and c3930062e45967af is a piece of shit scumbag who can't own up to his own mistakes even after overwhelming evidence and player response that this is the worse rework ever.I see how it is. 
140;1929; Because c3930062e45967af's a tool. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be offensive or rude but when you treat us like idiots that main Cassiopeia yet act like you know her more than we do, which is extremely disrespectful. Well. You deserved to be told you're a tool, c3930062e45967af.

140;2182; It's so sad, Cassiopeia was such a unique mage too . . being able to single-handedly 1v1 a Yasuo or Jax if played correctly was so rewarding. And she had SO MANY UNIQUE BUILD PATHS.My personal favorite was.Rod Of AgesLiandry's TormentVoid StaffSorcerer's ShoesRylai's Crystal ScepterZhonya's Or DeathcapAnd with this build I was doing such great damage, and it felt so fun. Now she's ruined, another main champion of mine has been changed into something I never wanted (Previously was Gragas, so I decided I won't main a mainstream champion and so I went to Cassiopeia {Because no one really played her}) and boom she's gutted.c3930062e45967af, adea0de5de6d3836 has screwed up many times and I will always dislike that idiot but you . . I have such a deep hatred for. Yes, I said it.**** you dude. I hope you NEVER massacre another champion again you freaking delinquent.Being compassionate and reasonable with this guy isn't helping, so I'm just venting in the classical way.

140;2304; Quote: a390c313de73e558: I'm willing to bet all the math that has been done cannot account for the poison detection changes nor her ult detection changes. That's why you have more losses than wins and a KDA of 2.0 on Cass, right? That better detection came at the cost of removing the ult's damage and reducing the range by about 50. Wow, so much better detection, it accurately makes your range lower than it was before. 20% range win rate in games that end under 25 minutes and a win rate below 50% until 45 mins +. You're either a shill or you're retarded. Probably both. These fgts are probably the mains and smurfs of Rioters trying to talk trash in this thread. 
140;2311;"Why are you talking to him? Respond to my post with the link which proves you're talking out of your ass. Zero credibility - Meanwhile everything he said has been posted multiple times in this thread including immediately after him, yet you conveniently missed it... multiple times. Here, I'll quote myself: Quote: bb29804e0b8513a9: The link to what you're talking about - http://lolbuilder.net/news/how-bad-is-the-new-cassiopeia 27.8% (that's a typo it seems, 27.6% if you want to be precise) in games that end before 25 mins, and doesn't hit 50%+ until 45 mins. Only 3 days of stats so far since the patch on Thursday; Today's win rate in NA at Diamond: 42.47% It's been in the low 40s all 3 days. So the E bug fix (BS fix, they knew what they were doing and left it at 0.7 intentionally) did make a difference but still leaves Cass in the gutter. Her win rate isn't 28-34% at high Elo anymore, but being in the high 30s to low 40s is still horrendous. "
140;2314; Quote: 14cb9d1edca26110: So what is it exactly that you want? get her a .65 ratio on q? buff her E range to 800???? lol. That still wouldn't make up for the damage removed from her kit. Take your lol (you're not actually laughing unless you're demented and retarded) and shove it up your shill ass. - Base damage on spells gutted - Q's 0.8 (from 0.9) ratio dropped to 0.35 - W's 0.15 ratio dropped to 0.1 (along with the devastating base damage of 30 at max level, 30) - E's ratio also nerfed until it's maxed out - R's ratio dropped from 0.6 to 0.5 along with being more accurate (shorter range despite what the indicator shows) Lol Quote: a390c313de73e558: I tried her in patch 4.17 and she is stronger than before. Yeah ignore the 42% win rate now that she's much stronger than before. You're barely Plat trash who has no idea how to play mid considering all your heavily negative stats with zero CS. Why are you talking? 
140;2320; Quote: 14cb9d1edca26110: I don't in what kind of environment you were raised in but you definitely could use some manners You come in here full troll mode spilling absolute BS and then you say whaaaa you have no manners. If you're going to be an idiot and talk straight out of your ass and attempt to contradict hard facts then you're going to get called out on it. It's been mathematically proven she does less damage than before, it doesn't take a genius to know that without doing the math but it was done to shut trolls like you up. And the stats of tens of thousands of games combined proves she loses horribly until 45+ minutes. Removing all her damage, reducing her ult range while calling it more accurate, and lowering her late game damage somehow makes her fine and a hyper carry? You are a troll, a shill, delusional, an idiot or all of the above. 
140;2327; Quote: 14cb9d1edca26110: I am not trolling, i am giving my opinion. you only consider the damage changes instead of taking the qol buffs into account. that is your choice and i respect it, but please just stop acting like you're from the ghetto. you're on a forum with educated people, therefor you should act like an educated person. Debate with ideas, not insults. Otherwise please leave cause you're just being repulsive. If there were proper moderators this troll would have been banned a long time ago for trying to start flame wars. Talks out of his ass, annoys everyone, then calls everyone rude and repulsive for proving him wrong with plain facts. I'm betting you have no friends in real life since you have so much time to troll. Quote: a390c313de73e558: Someone link me the math please so I can look through it.

And you're hilarious bringing up my rank as if my MMR hasn't been to Gold 1 and back. I average more than 130 CS a game and I don't average 8.4 deaths a game minus anomalies, and that's with 30 4v5s, so yeah I'd say I'm better. Even if I was worse, so what? When someone is dying 12 times a game while scrounging 130 CS it's not so crazy to suggest trying other champs.You've done nothing to organize this thread.You want to talk trash about ranks, how about you post on your Bronze 5 main instead of hiding on a low level smurf then?

I love this guy Trying to organize this thread - Goes on to talk **** on his smurf instead of his main because he's a coward.Why are you linking normals (Edit: My bad, I'm blind) when I was talking about your ranked Cass games since the rework? Your Cass CS number is 132 average, 8.4 deaths a game since the rework minus the one game with no deaths.My stats include tons of team 5v5 games where I'm mid facing Diamonds and Plats, and 30 4v5s. Your stats are you being dumpstered by low Silvers.Stop embarrassing yourself, no one cares you're terrible. Your pathetic attempt to try to slander me won't make you seem better.

140;2809;I just want to point out I think you (061db2a0c94c729b) are super overrating the current Cass as you have 8 hojillion games on her and are in a lower Elo than you belong, not to mention it's so rare to see a Cass that most people don't know how to fight it. Once you get back to the Elo you belong, once people become more adept at facing Cass, her win rates will go down, not up. And regardless, her early and mid games are a joke, she's weak even half an hour in. Nearly all games are already decided by 30 minutes if not already over. Quote: 436d8248538d8377: She doesn't need buffs. She is just fine right now and she scales very well. A champion who struggles to hold a 40% win rate and you come in saying She's strong I hope she doesn't get nerfed, wow so strong, so broken, wow too much, don't buff or nerf pls Either post on your real account, which you won't and we all know why, or STFU and get lost you sniveling little tool. 
140;2812; Quote: 436d8248538d8377: She doesn't need buffs. She is just fine right now and she scales very well.

Cass is over, everyone refund your Cass skins and go home.PS: You've succeeded at being the most annoying troll I've seen in a long time with your BS.

If you're bronze 2 and have a cruddy KDA or are going even in lane, THIS SUGGESTS YOU ARE WHERE YOU BELONG. The system doesn't raise you up just for trying, that's not how winning works. And if you're convinced you're at because of your teammates, you're never going to improve because you're too self-centered to believe it could ever possibly be because of you as well. Improving doesn't happen by yelling at your teammates or noticing how many things they do wrong - how in god's name are you going to win and do what you need to do if you spend more time focusing on your teammates and not yourself? Sounds like a load of bull to me.

I like how you keep bring this up when no ever said being Diamond meant we knew more about dominion. We said it meant we had better mechanical skill and we knew more about 1v1 match ups. Which is true. This doesn't apply to dominion. This applies to league of legends.

It was supposed to get a ranked queue, but you know what happened? It fell flat pretty quickly, it was extremely hyped but after about two weeks people gave up on it and now it only caters to those who are new to the game or those who have been playing dominion for awhile. The problem is, dominion isn't challenging or engaging. You think the mobility creep is bad in SR then you obviously haven't played dominion very seriously... The challenge is have the team with the best mobility and that's it. There's hardly any strategy that goes into playing dominion when you faceroll over your opponents with OP champions and then proceed to take the points. Not to mention that there are champions who would be completely obsolete. LLMAOOOOO pls... stop making yourself look like an idiot. Just to pin your point to the wall.. Last weeks tournament had an Anivia in the finals (and it won). Youve been around since S1 right? How mobile is Anivia?

Again if you and the rest think it's so easy and you know better then make your own game company and run it how you want and see how well that works out for you. I and most of the community would rather trust Riot and the people with the knowledge and background to discuss these ideas and the pitfalls and advantages of them then listen to someone trying to be act smarter then they are. Yes you're speaking out of your ass. Please tell me what part of my post is not correct? Yes I'm not kissing 8e65b082c4262407's feet, but someone has to balance you puppies like you that pee themselves from happiness just because red is in the thread. After all this time and mismanagement of the mode we deserve deeds and demonstration of grasping the basic facts, not cookie cutter words. It deserves to be downvoted because it fails epically at understanding basic points that are being presented in this thread crystal clear. I appreciate 8e65b082c4262407's effort, but his lack of understanding is terribly dissappointing: 1. He doesn't get solo queue and team ranked is not the same. 2. He doesn't get draft queue and ranked is not the same. I'm not queuing for draft so I don't need ranked - please tell me where is logic in that? And what does ranked with all the recognition, prizes and legitimacy that goes with it and draft have in common, apart from simple champions drafting??? 3. He seemingly isn't even aware Riot killed Dominion draft themselves and draws conclusion there should be no dominion ranked because dominion draft is dead. 4. He still doesn't get that existence of ranked (no matter how small percentage of people actually play it) increase population of people that play normals because it gives it legitimacy and feeling that knowledge from normals will translate some day to ranked. This is no brainer and several very clever participants pointed that out. Sorry 8e65b082c4262407, I believe you're fantastic at what you do, which is player's behavior and such (sorry if I'm wrong), but for now, your contribution to this particular discussion fails to deliver and leaves me thinking that if your lack of understanding reflect how the whole Company's got lost with this, we are in hopeless situation and we are pushing water up the hill. So as much as I appreciate your spending time with us, I'd rather hear from someone who is more knowledgeable about this topic than you.

It wasn't the lack of balance with some champs in the mode that inspired me to stop playing, it was the community that played it seemed to be going down the crapper and the death of the draft queue was simply final nail in that coffin which proved that point. A playerbase that only plays the mode that is the crutch that those who can't handle the full strategy of the game rely on is not a strong playerbase. Maybe Riot should fix the mode, but I can't necessarily fault them for placing their focus elsewhere when the playerbase that plays the mode doesn't necessarily care about the integrity of it either. Seriously, just stop, and quit while you can ... Because it's obvious you haven't read any of this thread and are simply posting out of your ass

It's not so much that your comments are stupid, ignorant, and irritating, as they are completely devoid of grasping the reality, deeply unsatisfactory and missing the whole soccer ball so much that you flip in the air and fall right down flat on your dick.

647;1581; Quote: 00d48f62e5b339fd: Hey guys, We appreciate the passion, and we're going to try to address this with a one, two punch. I'm going to talk high-level League design philosophy and a83be08248cb1db4 will jump in with some Dominion specifics. First, Dominion isn't going anywhere. Ascension is a new temporary game mode that we hope you'll enjoy, but it is just using some Dominion assets, not replacing the game. However, this is a good opportunity to reaffirm why we like temporary game modes in the first place. League is largely centered around Summoner's Rift. That focus lets us design the game specifically for that map. We can make decisions about everything from movement speed to ult cooldowns with SR in mind. We constrain ourselves if we have to make sure a design change will work on any number of maps, and it bloats the game and introduces bugs when we make a lot of special case rules about items or abilities for the alternate maps. We still do it, but it's a last resort. Now that's largely an argument for why it's easier for us to develop with a single map focus. But we think there is also benefit for players above and beyond our just being able to offer a better experience. The more maps and alternate game modes we offer, the more it subdivides the player population. We're at a state where that situation isn't too bad, but imagine what League would feel like with a dozen maps, and players split among all of them. It's one of the challenges of matchmaking that the more game modes you support, the harder it is to find a good game for anyone. Furthermore, it just divides up the mind share. Games like soccer and chess aren't played on a variety of maps. There are some variant rules, and they serve similar goals as ours do: to give players something more when they've gotten a little bored of the standard way to play. This is one of the reasons we spun up a team to specifically focus on temporary game modes, such as URF, Doombots and now Ascension. We feel like we can offer a fun and novel way to play League, without the commitment to eternal upkeep, especially for those modes that end being less awesome than some of the others. I mention this, because we think the future of alternate maps for League lies with alternate game modes (and I'm specifically talking maps with different rules -- cosmetic art changes to existing maps is a different topic). In the meantime, we do have Twisted Treeline, Crystal Scar and Howling Abyss, and we want to keep supporting them, recognizing that they aren't as central to the game as Summoner's Rift and therefore will probably never have the audience of Summoner's Rift. We also understand the perception of a vicious spiral here. Specifically, the less attention Riot pays to those maps, the less likely the audience is to grow, which means Riot is less likely to pay additional attention, and so on. Take your cancer back to WoW you damn crab. / didn't like you there and I don't like you now.

If you can't empathize, then do the courtesy of shutting your trap. It's never in good taste to speak of the recently deceased in a bad light, especially if it's only expressing your generalistic, egocentric, f ucked up world view. Suicide maybe be a p ussying out move, but that was her choice, and you should fucking respect that she had the courage to take her own life, because most wouldn't have the balls to do it. I'd say it's more cowardly to wallow in sadness and depression than it is to do something about it, either by ending it or trying to fight your way out. Either way, attacking someone who recently died if the most cowardly move of all. Eat a fat one.

The only f ucked-up world view are those who sympathize with someone this pathetically selfish. Again, that's supremely retarded. That's like saying I shouldn't move away from this abusive neighborhood because I have some friends here who'll be hurt or i shouldn't break up with this girl because her feeling would get hurt, except taken to the ultimatum. She has ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY over her own life. Her decision is hers alone, and no one else can or should interfere with decisions regarding it. If someone you cared for committed suicide, would you go around saying that she was a *****, an egotistical, selfish and self-centered? Of f ucking course not, you'd empathize and try to understand. You'd grief, you'd be sad, hurt, but you'd move on, and later on you'd respect that decision because you have no choice other than condemning her for it forever instead, which, if you truly cared, you wouldn't do. Regarding your petty irrelevant feelings and the feelings of those around you more highly than your own, when deciding on whether you wanna suffer more or end it, is majorly retarded. She made her choice. Respect that choice.

Your not children, this isnt some day care, everyone that plays has to be thirteen or older, thirteen yr olds know EXACTLY what they are doing at any given time, all this I want chat logs I want proof, Riot is simply empowering snot nosed morons who have been empowered all their lives by weak ass parenting and now they feel they are basically entitled to everything. Well heres a free tip, your not entitled to anything, I know your parents should hae broke this too you a long time ago, take it up with them, but the truth of the world is no one cares and nobody owes you anything. lol. Get used to it. I'm assuming (based on how you're talking about people being empowered by their parents) that you were never loved as a child or had harsh parents. How about YOU get over it. If your point is correct then NO ONE has to acknowledge what you're saying EITHER. I agree somewhat with the OP to be honest. I Haven't got banned yet, but he does make some pretty good points. You just wanna come on here and bash people. When you're probably some ugly nerd that was never loved by his harsh parents.

Whats a dick move/verbiage to you may not be so for someone else. Hints the fact that in 1 game you can get reported and the other you may get honored for having the same action/mentality. It is somewhat subjective but I really don't understand why its such a difficult concept.If your mother told you to be nice. Would you deem it impossible to be nice because she didn't define every single thing that is nice and what isn't? Quote: 8e65b082c4262407: Hey,It looks like you were banned for excessive verbal abuse. You tell teammates to stfu, call teammates dumb, stupid, *******, b*tch, jerk, idiots, trash, dumbass, f*cking dumbass, and more. are you telling me you didn't know all these things are you being a dick?It seems to me that you know what you did and you know it was bad you just didn't care because you didn't think it was bad enough to warrant punishment. 
1157;40; Quote: 4e4ca83dc07cc79d: well, i have been playing for over 2 years. never been banned, never been restricted, never been warned. obviously i know something about not being a dick. i act how i act in the real world. seems to be working for me. you should drop the whole whiney twerp thing, sack up, and act like an grown up.

From that thread you are literally a jackass from page 48-52 or so. This is you in real life too? You pretty much just troll threads and when you have nothing to say you start calling people stupid and mentally challenged. Just gonna leave you there.

You don't like that riot doesn't allow you to be a dick.You can try to belittle people all you want and act tough but people like the OP are creating a negative experience for massive amounts of players.Dont get me wrong, I'm not some fragile person offended by everything people say(in fact im not sure ive ever been offended by words). When every game basically had become a rage fest I didn't come to the forums and cry about it, I didn't lobby for the current system to be implemented. I simply played less and less because it was no longer enjoyable and had basically quit. On top of the fact that it was just a depressing environment to be in, I watched games thrown over and over just because of a raging lunatic. You actually troll just as much as this laheysadrunk guy. I pulled some of his stuff from a previous forum post where you're pretty much doing the same thing. A pattern that seems to pop up anytime someone doesn't agree with 8e65b082c4262407.You're both exceedingly repetitive without actually ever making any kind of point as well. You both posit that everyone should just be kind to one another and not dicks, though you both lack the kindness you ask for and often come across as dicks anyway because you resort to childish behavior when your arguments are made invalid.

You can't really find posts by anyone. You'd be hard pressed going that route. I do however have some threads saved because 8e65b082c4262407 closes em at random and it's not hard remembering someone who trolls as hard as you.

1849;25; Both were wrong. Stop saying one was wrong or another.d527590b640b450e: Seriously? You're gonna be THAT much of a d*ck? First off, bffe79b5fbb0fe47 ALREADY PAID THE PRICE IN SEASON 2. It was DEALT WITH. There was no friends of Riot saving her. She already was punished. I actually played with bffe79b5fbb0fe47 once (Normals). Very cool, nice, friendly person. You didn't have to be a gigantic d*ck.83f551964002b007: Dude get off your highhorse. No matter what someone does, that wasn't deserved. Two wrongs don't make a right. You stooped to his level. You should have reported him, and contacted customer support. Or used bffe79b5fbb0fe47's Riot friends. Or whatever. He should be punished by RIOT'S standards, not YOURS. 
1849;58; Honestly d527590b640b450e you've been going in that chat and spamming at bffe79b5fbb0fe47 every day maybe you should just stop making an ass of yourself.

Yeah, for sure. Let's forget about that. Let's just pretend only 83f551964002b007 is in the wrong, meanwhile everyone harassing bffe79b5fbb0fe47 for no reason is perfectly acceptable in the eyes of GD. You really think that 4ff0ed08daf3605b made all 218 pages of that skype convo up? That would take alot of time, hours upon hours upon hours.Read them, and then come back to me.If you would stop thinking with your virgin dick and realize not all females are pure white doves then alot of this wouldn't even be an issue.Also lol at how you stuck up for me. That ****s gonna come back at you boy, sleep on that.763164 blackguy.jpeg

I certainly don't want my intimate conversations published with the whole world.And sticking up for you by asking Can I apologize for him is literally the best I can do, because I honestly think you're scum for calling any female a ***** and would never try and defend that.Also, I'm curious as to what you mean by, it's going to come back at me. I'm intrigued. 
1849;113; Quote: 9e298a1b76bbd3bb: Getting hacked and calling someone a name are two different things. Getting hacked can actually present a problem. Being told words that you find offensive is arguably less upsetting.Besides, bffe79b5fbb0fe47 already has someone to defend her, all the people who got hacked accounts only have Riot support, which is not very supportive. No, you are retraded and don't even understand what I said. You are comparing one incident to another of equal degree, thus, one should hold no precedence over the other because they are equal. People get called names all the time, no big deal. Well, if you're going to use that logic, people get hacked all the time. No big deal. Quote: d527590b640b450e: You know what I consider an invasion of privacy? Having my credit card info/account/email and then being transferred.As for her being a *****763179I'll let you sleep on it, k? k.763180 You were in the chat. I don't know how long, but he did say how he was accessing all the accounts. He doesn't have access to credit cards, or passwords. He apparently uses a code that let's him log into whatever account he wants. The credit cards and passwords are encrypted, but judging by what he said, Riot was stupid enough to leave the key somewhere on the servers and he found it. Or he brute forced it. Either way, get mad at Riot.Also, I hope that face is in my dreams. I honestly hope so. Quote: 1fc920fc5448035b: What a dumb statement why do we care this guy got hacked. its not right, it's like saying oh why do we care that THAT girl got murdered or raped? Girls get rapped all the time! Its injustice and immoral. Again what a terrible terrible statement. See, you're not understanding the argument so I'm going to drop it. If you take 2 equal events, and say it happens all the time and neither one is more important than the other, then you have to take ALL equal events and not hold precedence of one over the other. That does NOT mean, she was raped, girls get raped all the time. That means, they were BOTH raped, but neither rape should be more important than the either: AKA, why do we care that d527590b640b450e got hacked, people got hacked all the time. That's the logic you're using to disregard people harassing bffe79b5fbb0fe47. 
1849;137; Quote: 681f6c2cd7462326: Ok, in the first place, there is a difference between name calling and harassing. Harassing over league or the forums or anything is bullying. Which is very serious, to be honest, really hurting someone and harassing them for anything even mistakes seems a bit worse than someone getting their account hacked. Yes, this guys sees your personal info. He hasn't used it as of yet and he already showed he knows your full name and email without even getting on your account. So I see where the argument is being made. I no way is getting an account hacked right, but in the same sense you are defending a bully to some degree who went through and an inconvenience due to him being an idiot. If you know someone has power you don't provoke them. If a man has a gun, you don't go up to them and start making fun of them. Its common sense. People get harassed all the time in real life and nothing gets done about it. This is the internet, which is far less severe. I'm in no way going to bully her myself, and in no way defending people bullying her, and I'm not saying it's the right thing to do, but I don't think it deserves a bunch of people defending this person. These people would never defend someone else getting harassed. They probably go into league matches with people telling others to commit suicide and don't say a word about it.I agree that OP was stupid for pushing it, I agree it was mean, I just don't agree that 318f5fc599b67076 thinks that name-calling and hacking are on the same level as each other. 
1849;209; Quote: f2890d78074f5388: No, I am not 884a706112a1c668, I am God. So you're 1caa9b57408654d1 or a troll who wants attention.884a706112a1c668 is an account 1caa9b57408654d1 had access to, although I think it was banned. 
1849;214; Quote: 318f5fc599b67076: What gives you the right to judge which wrong's have more weight over others? I mean clearly, all injustices should be held equal no? Unless there's a certain code that I've somehow missed. Dude...I think you're dumb.All injustices should be held equal?Let's have someone speeding get life a long side murderers.Or let someone with a petty burglary charge go on death row. 
1849;221; Quote: 318f5fc599b67076: I'm actually an Atheist, thank you. And judging from your responses your aren't intellectually sound to discuss such topics, so I suggest you let it be. Oh I'm sorry, I was actually trying to give you an out by saying that, you realize. Otherwise if you make the argument that all injustices are equal, you're just dumb.Again, my apologies, I guess you are just dumb.

G'night, have fun sleeping on the wrong evil side cause you're wrong and dumb and nobody likes you or your opinion cause it's stupid and doesn't matter to me because I can quick scope on COD and I watch LCS streams all the time so that makes me a pro so my opinion is the only thing that matters and people who try to give me advice on leagues is just a toxic anti-fun troll./end sarcasm

1849;267; from what i've read, honestly this 4ff0ed08daf3605b guy deserved his perma, i do feel sorta bad for him quitting everything important, to try to make a career out of league, but honestly if it was so important to him he should have put his all into not being a toxic player and becoming a role model. (i hear he was a repeat offender, not learning from a multitude of offenses)with all the bffe79b5fbb0fe47 nonsense, im sure he elo boosted several other people besides her, and im sure there are plenty of other people who have been elo boosted and are not punished by the system, honestly if they didnt earn their rank then it will show, and who really cares, doubt your gonna see her in s4 LCS or anything so, w/e right?4ff0ed08daf3605b was clearly banned for more than just elo boosting, that was just 1 of many offenses. as for OP, you were kinda acting like a scumbag, and i can tell your previous comments were something you'd find in the DMC remakes script, so its rough to agree with you but i do agree, someone getting their account taken and moved is a pretty unnecessary retaliation as well as a bit extreme/illegal, its pretty much stealing, and their are better ways to deal with toxic players....(mute them.). so...Scumbags everywhere pretty much.All i see is a lot of people doing a lot of unnecessary things, Did 4ff0ed08daf3605b deserve his perma? Clearly he did. Did this bffe79b5fbb0fe47 person get boosted? it would appear so, but does she deserve a perma? i would say no, a warning or something, and at the worst temp suspension for repeat offending, i dont believe she was anywhere near as toxic as he was, i didnt read everything but i read some stuff, and if what i read is true then it was pretty ****ed up but the worlds a pretty ****ed up place, people should take their own advice, just like how op can be(act like) a tool and harass people, dosent mean he deserved to be hacked, bffe79b5fbb0fe47 can be a user all she wants and still not deserved to get banned/flamed. somebody ****s you over you grow up remove them from your life and move the **** on, thats what adults do, this flaming bs is for the kids, still in their adolescents. you got your account back so its cool, youve let the authorities know and, im sure riot will do something about the hacking situation, because i agree its way over the top and should be met with the most strict of punishments as it is a challenge and direct defiance of the rules(summoners code ect) you've made your post and honestly i hope you've learned as im sure the hacker will learn soon, its not cool to **** with people, dont make the same mistakes twice bro. 
1849;295; Quote: dcaaf2dfb2fc054f: I found it funny that bffe79b5fbb0fe47 was totally down for that. Why? It's always been rather evident that she is a scumbag. 
1849;302; Quote: 9e298a1b76bbd3bb: At the risk of being risky... and... I'm going to say this as nicely as possible... As a girl, I feel really bad for bffe79b5fbb0fe47. She's got this guy that will hack accounts and send people to other servers for her so that she will never have to stand up for herself. What if somebody finds her in public and starts cussing her out and berating her over this stuff? 1caa9b57408654d1 will not be around to help her and she'll be so utterly devastated because of how dependent upon other people she is for her comfort.That being said, 1caa9b57408654d1 isn't a bad guy, and it is really easy to avoid making him server transfer you, so OP was kind of asking for it.I'm just confused that Riot can't or seemingly won't stop him from doing it. They must have a problem with it, right?... Don't they? This is the most ridiculous post I've ever seen.bffe79b5fbb0fe47:-used another human being and made him feel awful for personal gain. No matte how much you dislike 4ff0ed08daf3605b, this is still wrong.-plays at a boosted ELO, ruining the experience for others. I don't car how nice this girl is. It's still wrong!1caa9b57408654d1:-hacked somebody's account with credit cards on it and transferred it to another sever. This is WRONG, and calling your friend/girlfriend is not something that justifies this. He is retaliating to something as little as namecalling with something way above and beyond what's necessary. It's like burning somebody's house down because they said that your car is. piece of ****. Your level of overreaction in these situations comes from a power trip mentality - one that you probably have never been able to replicate in real life...which is why you get off on doing this stuff so much.When 95% of a community is banded against something, why not open your mind and see that there is clearly something wrong here? Indont care how much you like bffe79b5fbb0fe47 - the way she did 4ff0ed08daf3605b was WRONG. The fact that she got special name changing privs over others is unfair, and her playing in an ElO that she doesn't belong in really does affect others experience in the game.Saying something like 1caa9b57408654d1's a good guy and he had plent of chances to not get his account stolen. This is such a dumbass statement it makes me sick. He was namecalling. Justifying committing a legal crime where you take something that somebodyas spent money on and attempting to sabotage it makes you a ridiculously ****ty human being. If he was REALLY sucka great guy, he would be trying to clear bffe79b5fbb0fe47's name instead of just making people hate her more, which is exactly what is happening. Maybe he's no trying to clear her name because he knows she's guilty of all that she's been accused of. 
1849;330; Quote: 6a1a2c5620aa7c2e: 4ff0ed08daf3605b had some friends.Emotionally unstable? I'll give you that one. First of all, if that's the only part of my post that's exaggerated, it does nothing for your argument and you look dumb. Second of all, by lonely, I meant male-female interaction. He was not experienced with females, having a cute girl show interest in him causedhis emotions to explode. You're trying so hard to nitpick in order to defend horrible actions, but it's not going to work. Takig a sad person and making them more sad for personal gain is not justifiable, and here is no way you will convince me that I am exaggerating how much of a total ***** move that was.And if 4ff0ed08daf3605b was such an idiot for putting himself in that situation, what does that make you, 1caa9b57408654d1, and anybody else coming to her aid at the moment? How do you know she won't burn you guys when she finds the next BBD? 
1849;345; Quote: 6a1a2c5620aa7c2e: Stop exaggerating. I doubt he had 0 female experience till bffe79b5fbb0fe47.You're defending 4ff0ed08daf3605b very hard and trying to make him seem like a innocent guy. Must of been played by a girl? Im not defending 4ff0ed08daf3605b. Hes a total jackass. But that doesnt mean bffe79b5fbb0fe47 isn't a *****. She is, and there is no exaggeration in saying that she's a horrible person. Every time you say quit exaggerating I will respond with quit underplaying.And don't make this abou me. This has nothing to do with me. I am happy enough with my life that I don't need to qualify myself to you, and experienced enough to understand why this situation is ****ed up. Have I ever been played or used? Yeah, of course. Anybody with experience in the dating world has felt played or used at some point in their lives. But how a person who is confident and happy and optimistic in life handles that is waaaaaaay different than how a person who is unhappy, pessimistic, and has no self esteem handles it.Here, let me to ahead and predict your response.blah how blah no actual method of defending bffe79b5fbb0fe47 or 1caa9b57408654d1's behavior, stop exaggerating.Just stop it. You care too much abou winning this argument on the Internet to realize that you make yourself look like a stupid white knight who lacks the empathy to understand what getting **** in by a female feels like.

You're obviously biased as can be on the topic, and really don't seem to wish to get to a resolution so much as continue to argue for attention. I desperately hope that one day someone will care for you, and you will receive the help you so desperately need. Until then, my apologies in advance for ignoring you, and best luck on the discussion. Anyway. Glad that's out of the way. Lol wow, that was almost hilarious. If you would have even read my post it was nowhere near to in favor of the guy. But good job on being a gigantic d ildo, I won't stoop to your level and go on an insult spree though.

Don't you have any sort of pride ?@ OP : props on calling him out on his BS.Did this happen before or after the PW changes ? Because if it was after, it looks like Riot still got some job on their hands. Also, lol @ dcaaf2dfb2fc054f losing any credibility left.

You have nothing useful to be said, and constantly backtrack on yourself to make yourself seem more morally aligned. It's impossible to discuss anything with anyone when they have no consistency and no care to see a resolution. That's you, and you're not worth the time of anyone within this thread.Hopefully that's a little more specific. I regret having gone back on my word and having replied to you, I assure you, this is the last. Have yourself a wonderful night. Chao. Says he won't waste time replying to me.Replies to me twice.I said insult spree. I only insulted you once. :3I have pretty great consistency. I've been around on threads like these since 884a706112a1c668/83f551964002b007/1caa9b57408654d1 started this stuff, and have been trying to bring Riot's attention to it the whole time. I've never said it was a good thing, I never said he should be let off like you think I did. I never advocated him like you seem to feel I have. You probably have me confused with somebody else.But if you're super serious about not replying to me, I assure you I'm quite pleased with that as you are a massive tool. I regret having gone back on my word and insulting you again.P.S. Please make some smurfs and downvote me some more.

All 3 of you are attention *****s, difference being you're just trying to insult people and get under their skin.It's not slander if there's evidence, it's slander if you're just aimlessly accusing people of ****, lol. You can upvote yourself on 15 accounts if you want, but it's still obvious to anyone who reads the thread that that's what you're doing.

Blame Riot for making borders meaningless. LOLOLOLOLOLOh and joining a 5v5 challenger team that you didn't play a single game on is not elo boosting.PLEASE, stop ... my side hurt ...Someone playing on someone else account and bring it to challenger is nto considering boosting?ok, so i can have someone bo bring my account to gold 5 and not be banned?

1891;50; Quote: 076e1d3fb38feadb: People who claim they have been unstable for months are dumb. I've been playing fine until the lizard squad started ****ing with the servers the last week. Must be nice for you. However I'm ****ing tired of trying to play this game and having someone be dropped or getting trapped in a non existing game. Or the constant clipping the game seems to have now. Or the constant 120 ping (used to be 90 a season ago). Just because your lucky doesn't mean it doesnt exist. If it didn't exist there wouldn't be so much outrage about. So kindly stfu and leave your opinions to yourself. 
1891;68; Quote: 5526e10cf34308c2: have yet to follow through with one upgrade to this game for over five years. You. Are. So. Dumb. 
1891;78; Quote: 5526e10cf34308c2: You know Riot, DDOS Attacks are from internet terrorists who use it as a form of protesting, it is not like it is a force of nature that randomly spawns and we have no control over it, maybe if you guys didn't neglect everything since Beta things wouldn't be as bad...You guys make promises time and time again but provide no information about it and have yet to follow through with one upgrade to this game for over five years. What is your solution to this? More 10-20 dollar skins. Why is THIS game singled out and targeted exclusively? I don't see anyone complaining about it on other games. You're a ****ing idiot. That would be because it's the single most popular game in the world. That makes it the best target. The teams making content also have nothing to do with network issues, and in fact, if you try to take artists, or even programmers who aren't experienced enough with network programming and stick them on this issue, it will not help. This issue isn't just a riot issue, but an issue for the ENTIRE infrastructure of the internet. Do you realize how much data 200-400 gbps is? Most connection speeds are in the range of 10-40mbps. That's a difference of about 10000x. Imagine that's all being written to your computer's hard drive. That 1tb hard disk you have is filled theoretically, in under 3s, and that's assuming you can even write that fast or your cpu can process data that fast (it can't). This is a massive amount of trash data on a scale you can't comprehend, and this issue is far bigger than riot. This issue is a result of poor infrastructure, a lack of good ways to persecute the people behind the attacks, and the fact that all of that information being sent still has to be filtered out at some point without ****ing your in game ping. All of that processing takes time, and the ddos attacks significantly increase the traffic on the network to the point where having enough processing power to handle peak hours several times over doesn't cut it. 
1891;352; Quote: 2ea96959e80aa556: You're under some misconception that the attack HAS to come from outside the United States? That's cute. Lol ur retarded. You think a group of teenagers DDOSing large internet companies while being sought after by the FBI and haven't been raided yet are from the US? That's cute. 
1891;447; Quote: d99e4f9d054e3336: I'm a madam tyvm. And I am not naive at all. I have spoken to several of the rioters and they do give a care. But all I am saying is YOU CHOOSE to pay for things that are of no influence to the game itself. The Game is FREE. And the money they get from the skin purchases and what not goes to keeping the game up and running. It isn't free to host these things and to develop these things and people seem to forget that. EVERYTHING COSTS SOMETHING. Stop treating the people who brought you the game like **** It's a free game that makes revenue and more importantly profit. When they stop making profit, they will shut the game down. As far as I'm concerned, I havent been rude towards them, I just stated facts. Moreover, do you are that naive that you believe they keep getting the revenue JUST for keep the game running? Do you think the CEO'S and big guys dont want some profit in their pockets?You've a weak point and you keep repeating it over and over again. Show me different points or shut up.You're really naive ma'am. If they really cared about their players, they'd have prioritized their servers over automatic ban tools, not saying it's not important tho.a7f1e715c6602f62 
1891;455; Quote: d99e4f9d054e3336: Ok sir, if you want a new point then fine here is one. Even with all the complaining and all the harsh and negative words is anything getting done to solve the problem by you or other summoners? No it is not. And if all riot can do is focus on giving into what everyone wants then they wont have time to fix any issues whatsoever. if you dont see this then you are the naive one. I am just making a point that people need to leave them the hell alone... And you definitely need to not attack people just for defending a game they love. You have a good point on some things but you are harsh and definitely set on your line of thinking. No one can suede a concrete mind and I dont plan to try to do so. Just take it easy on the game. Go bother some other company that is pay to play for having the same problems the free to play ones have. Because last i checked ALL games have the same problems Yeap, all games have this problem. The difference is how fast they solve and how proactive they are. Take this example, Tibia experienced a lot of attacks. Nowadays, if it happens, they take a day to fix it or even less. If the issue persists, they offer a benefit for the players. Tibia runs like League of Legends, free to play with special features for people that are willing to pay.Riot is a big target and so far, they are not trying to change anything. They just act when they are attacked. If they keep doing this behaviour, sooner or later people will get tired and will move to different platforms or games, such as DOTA 2.I have never attacked YOU, I was talking about your option and how it lacks support. It doesn't mean that I think that you are dumb or a sh.ithead. I just think you a little bit too naive towards how companies truly work.a7f1e715c6602f62 
1891;508; Quote: 4a5c5be9d14524c9: The money YOU gave them may cover a technician to fix 1gb of their server space. You are so stupid I don't even know where to begin. Game last year alone netted 600+ million dollars in profits out of the 900 million in revenue they earned, the very fact that you are trying to say that this game is funded by one person so they cant afford to upgrade means just how much bull **** you are pulling out of your ass, millions of people play this game, and this game earned millions. 
1891;510; Quote: 4a5c5be9d14524c9: Show me facts that Riot is not doing this. Give me a link to a quote from riot them selves. You cant tell me im wrong on an opinion i made myself, while you dont have any evidence to back up your own stories. Lizard Squad couldn't DDOS XBox Live for more than 3 minutes, Twitch recovered in 15 minutes, DOTA 2 has never been touched, just shut up. 
1891;517; Quote: 4a5c5be9d14524c9: Opinions are fine, facts are even better. But you people are hypocrites that tell me im wrong and cant even back up yourselves. While its obvious that one side is getting all the money, yet you tell em im wrong and show me a bunch of numbers you pulled out you butts. I rest my case. I know google is a big scary place, but I suggest you use it. 5526e10cf34308c2 and I aren't just spit-balling ideas to support ourselves. We're literally telling you facts that we have looked up. Do some damn research, kid. 
1891;723; Quote: 7d67c62ca91070c2: instead of playing LoL we should just play forum games....idk any but lets do it go on, nobody needs you and your bratty little **** mouth. Everyone's just as annoyed as you are. Riot said they're trying their best to fix the issue. Your complaining won't change or contribute anything and all you can and SHOULD do is just wait patiently and let Riot do their thing. It's a free game, whether if you want to pay or not is YOUR choice, they didn't force you to pay, and you should be grateful for that. Good luck with the issue Riot! Best of luck! 
1891;772; Quote: af18c47484776900: My view point is drop the act, if your being attacked then attack back. I made my own 3 computer Viruses when i was 13 and still to this day when i get a virus or am attacked on my PC i retrace and if you have the right equipment you can easily pinpoint the location if they have more than one transmitter and spike there entire system shutting them. This would give you a few days while they repair to set up stronger defenses. My laptop is unhackable duo top to my own 3 viruses i have created i use as my defense. you touch me i fry your circuts, so on so fourth. i dont work for you so i can not legally do this for u to give u time but you need to figure out an offense and do it secretlly they cant point fingers at you when they started this war now can they. Common sense goes farther than book smarts guys. Best of Luck hope you get this resolved. You sir, are stupid. That's not a good solution to the problem. And you have no idea what you are talking about. 
1891;867; Quote: 8c5d14a0f506aaa3: Why are people upvoting this nonsense? Riot is massively failing and blaming someone else per usual. Are you people really this stupid? You and all other people blaming riot, you call them stupid but yet you've played this game for years. You've played so much you got into the gold or diamond or challenger divisions. You've probably gone out and spent money to buy rp codes. You insult Riot yet you're clearly in love with their game. When I hate something or think it's stupid, I stop involving myself with it. HAHAHAHAHAH crazy right? And even more so, you insult Riot, but I don't see you doing anything better. Did you found a multimillion dollar company? Did you get a bachelors/masters/phD in networking or programming or any other computer related degree? Half of you probably aren't even old enough to go college yet, or you never went to college because you're content with working your low end 12 dollar an hour job contributing nothing to society other than rant posts on the internet and May I take your order? So kindly shut your noise hole until you can show us a server that protects 100% against any form of ddos. Oh you can't? Wow then maybe you have absolutely no room to be talking down to Riot.

Well, I'm 41 years old. I make more than enough to spend a few thousand on this game and not worry about it. I play because I enjoy the game. However, I do expect a certain return on investment. Just because I can afford to do whatever I want, does not mean that I don't want good customer service. In the last year, I have eclipsed the $5000.00 mark. I pay for my 3 boys and their friends to play. Champions, boosts, skins, etc... About 12 accounts in all. For the haters, I am not saying I deserve more than anyone else, I am saying that this is supposed to be the new meta in E-sports. I work my ass off for what I have. I have certain responsibilities at work, that if not upheld, I would get fired. Our customers accept no excuses. Nor, do I. Riot is a billion dollar company. This is not some private server. It is a business. Maybe it's time for you to realize that and stop flaming people that are pissed. They have an investment in this game, whether time, money, or both. So..please STFU and mind your own business

If OP is telling the complete truth (which I think she is due to Riot's propensity for poor service), Riot needs to prepare for a PR ****storm lol poor service...seriously? OP is friends with the hacker on skype. OP has given out password to someone else. Multiple riot staff have gone over it to make sure they all reached the same conclusion. Riot is more then willingly to continue the conversation in the ongoing ticket to try and get it cleared up because what they are seeing on the account is not matching what they are being told. How do you get 'poor service' out of any of that? You want poor service, go call comcast for help -.- Hell file a ticket in maplestory and let me know how that goes Riots service is pretty stellar 99% of the time. They are a pretty amazing company. Sucks OP got screwed over by a friend, and it'd be nice if Riot would be able to restore the account, but hating on riot for the OP's faults is pretty retarded. 
1941;205; Quote: 0efa649d7e5c546a: We also never said that your IP was the only one showing up on the account... we only said that we can see that when you log in, it is from the same IP.

1941;224; Quote: 419a7165784eea5d: Ok so there is more than 1 ip showing up on the account right? contradictions.. Are you stupid?

Would this kind of scenario make any kind of sense? Cause it sure as **** doesn't make sense to me, and it doesn't make sense now Are you comparing that real life **** with this?OP SIGNED an agreement that stated SHARING ACCOUNT IS NOT ALLOWED.

Yes, I understand that they shared the account one time, but if what op says is true and that person no longer has access, then it is completely unrelated to the situation. If op hadn't fessed up then they would have probably gotten all their **** back, but they did share and now they're being punished for it.

Because apparently, pointing out this very simple fact and exposing the OP for the idiot he is for both sharing his acc and most likely being the one who gave the info to his account through one method of another [ knowingly or not ], will draw the rage of this QQ circlejerk onto you. Hacking rarely ever happens [ true hacking ] and especially not to a nobody`s LoL account coz she didn`t give nudes to a teen lol. She either has a keylogger on her PC, friend still having access / sharing the access with his other friends as well or most likely ... weak password after the password change, since people usually use a single password across all things for all their life, being predictable as hell when forced to change it.

Your brain should require you to refund glucose for such useless thoughts.

1941;585; Quote: 0efa649d7e5c546a: Hey everyone, I'm going to clarify a misconception here. The account sharing was not just a small one-time incident. It was blatant, lengthy, repeated, and the direct cause of 2315eab6dabe4510's lack of runes. Also, all of this comes from our own analysis, not from what 2315eab6dabe4510 has said here or in the ticket. i called it, op the liar wanted sympathy gg 2315eab6dabe4510

Look at this thread and people saying 2315eab6dabe4510 doesn't deserve it.Why would anyone try to help this community. There is no hope in this community.Even if she did account share.Who in there right mind would get rid of all there runes and delete there friend list? Pretty sure no one that plays league as long as she has. From season 1 would ever do that.Maybe if she was asking for money or just give her back the IP from it. It would be a different story. She is asking for the runes back.But go on about your day calling me a smurf of 2315eab6dabe4510 and she doesn't deserve it because she account shared awhile ago. Please do it so I can believe more this community is utter trash It is that exact attitude that leads to that which you despise. You're a hypocritical fool that doesn't even understand the logic or the goal you so desire. I think you need to reconsider your attitude. If you desire change, then seek it by a means that can be changed. Do not simply deny that the logic does not exist if not thoroughly examined.

1941;838; Quote: 0feab038f7763577: look, another white knight for riot who cant read.2315eab6dabe4510 explicitly stated that the person she shared the account with was a close friend, and very rarely used the account. And when they DID use the account they only played normals or arams (1~3) before logging off.OP has also said that she changed her password - her friend had no access to the account at that point - and the account was still compromised.But keep believing that her friend screwed her over. I mean, Riot is never wrong right? Thats why 0efa649d7e5c546a is still talking to 2315eab6dabe4510 over private messages about this issue, and didnt just drop it right? stfu 
1941;883;I have spotted signs of Photoshop in the pictures you linked. You are a lying despicable thief and you weren't hacked you tried to use that as a cover up for your friend who ****ed up your account now you want sympathy and I bet you won't call the police because you mess with the police over this **** that's not even true they might lock your ass up for wasting their time you better now go back and grind the runes again that your FRIEND you gave account access to ruined this was not A HACKER YOU LIAR AND ONLY IDIOTS BELIEVE YOU

1941;947;I just don't get the people on this forum. Seriously just use a little bit of logic and you can see how blatantly full of **** OP is. What does 2315eab6dabe4510 have to gain from lying? Freely get all of her runes back What does Riot gain from lying? Absolutely nothing. The best case scenario is everyone forgets about it quickly, after an enormous **** storm for at least a few weeks. Who wins that? Riot If Riot had any doubt about the entire situation, why would they react as they have? It's illogical. In what universe does it make sense for a business to intentionally piss off their customers? Especially ones that have been around for years? The OP claims to have been asked for sexual favors, yet shows no evidence of said claim. On top of this, the evidence is horrible. I could literally re-create said evidence in under 60 seconds on Skype. First piece of evidence literally says nothing. No reference to anyone specifically and just generally says nothing about hacking of any kind. It could literally be someone talking about a friend who got a virus that destroyed their girlfriend's computer or something. Second piece of evidence doesn't show much of anything, either. Just because I can tell someone I can run a marathon doesn't mean I can in the slightest. Which makes more sense: Dumb ass 14 year old kid getting mad about someone talking **** to them and making idle threats, or a legitimate hacker getting mad and making a real threat? All the evidence really shows is the OP is talking **** and harassing someone, making threats of their own. Third piece? If one of those two were a friend of the OP, why would they be laughing and joking about the account getting hacked or their friend being sexually harassed? Maybe it's just me, but if I had a friend getting sexually harassed I would flip ****. I'm inclined to think most people that are friends would do the same. This leads me to think there's no way they are friends, which, in turn, leads me to believe there is no logical reason that piece (or the first) would be in the OP's possession in the first place. This leads me to believe the evidence was faked, although, in truth, it could be a case of severely bad judgment by the OP (which doesn't seem too far of a stretch). In the end it comes down to one question: Is Riot support full of greedy, corrupt employees who want nothing more than to ruin the experience of their players, or is the OP a greedy, corrupt person who ****ed up and wants someone else to pay for her mistake? Probability is weighted quite heavily in the favor of Riot. The logic just isn't on your side, OP. Sorry.
1941;957;" Quote: 077c4e9352195d7d: Both assumptions made assumed the person in question was wrong. What 2315eab6dabe4510 would gain from lying would be free runes because she lost them. What would Riot gain from lying? Absolutely nothing. It's not a question of whether or not Riot should restore the runes - that's a separate issue. It's a question of the validity of the accusations on both sides. My logic is simply based around the likelihood of the event. Again, which is more likely: Riot is corrupt or the OP is corrupt? That's not claiming Riot must always be right, it's claiming that Riot is simply not illogical. This is actually true for both; logically the OP should lie about this in an attempt to get her runes back, and, logically, Riot should not intentionally screw their player base for fun. Again, OP has far more to gain from lying than Riot. To directly clarify what my axiom is: Both sides perform their actions logically. I'm sorry my logic was hard for you to understand. I hope my points have clarified that for you. If someone spends time acquiring a currency and then spends that currency on a product, that product wasn't free. If someone destroys that product, having it restored doesn't result in free product. Sticking to the you did something against the ToS so you get nothing, other than hours of employee time is so irrational I can hardly believe it. But go on thinking that the unwashed peasants can't understand your godlike logic. Arrogant nitwit. "
1941;976; Quote: 38506e4bf8728885: She quoted that she got hacked, exactly. THE PERSON WHO HAS SOMETHING TO GAIN HERE CLAIMED SOMETHING THAT WOULD PUT HER IN A POSITION THAT WILL BENEFIT HER. I'm not just calling it white-knighting because she's a girl. White-knighting has gone beyond that in internet terms. White Knighting is when you defend someone without even knowing their actual damned issue. I'm not inclined to believe anything anyone says on the internet because 50% of you are liars. What you are suggesting is far more serious. You're claiming that the OP should not contact the authorities because they won't do anything Its worth a ****ing shot. I've played almost as long as OP. Of course I'd be damned frustrated if someone took that all away from me. But I'm sure as heck not stupid enough to give someone else my log in information. I'm also not brilliant enough to keep hackers on my contact list on Skype, or to download trojan's sent to me by someone I don't know. I already said I want OP to get her stuff back. The cops arent going to give her all her stuff back, but if they do take her seriously, they could help locate the person issuing said threats and something can be done legally. If the person in question is proved to exist and is proved to be punished by the law for said actions, perhaps OP can prove that he... well. Exists. Y'know. Instead of just being a blank text log. No, I don't know what ****ing sexual harassment is like beyond pics please nonsense over and over again until I block them. It doesn't mean I cant offer advice, and tell both parties on this matter to shut up because the white-knights have no idea what they're talking about, and the rekt kiddies aren't even doing anything but screaming rekt. You have no proof God you are really ignorant about the sexual harassment thing. Allow me to explain that even a toddler can understand. As a girl on this game you'd probably get TONS of comments from many different guys with rude disgusting comments like that. It maybe stereotyping but that how it happens. Real life and online. It happens. Why would this girl suddenly report to the authority? If it was so easy than it's easy for those who are sexually molested or been physically abused as a kid to report to the authorities on the get go. It just doesn't work like that at all. People occasionally pray the person would just cease and go away and find another victim to pray on. They don't want to cause any trouble. Do you report on anyone who sent you death threats? Of course not. Most of the time you expect they are joking. That's probably how 2315eab6dabe4510 felt with this man and didn't do a single thing. So yes it was a problem. And yes it does seem she values the runes more, but since she had to make a thread asking for runes, she more entitled to talk about retrieving her runes back. I'm sure if she went to a thread talking about her feelings about sexual harassment it would be what I've said. How do I know that? Because I have empathy and I've seen and been in a sitatuon like her. I've had rl friends who had trouble sleeping because their ex's won't leave them alone or a man tracking my address down and threatening to find me when I was 12. Do you even understand? No you don't. I'll be speechless if you still don't understand it after reading this tim bit. And no you can't offer advice. It's like asking a 12 year old how to manage my taxes. It's literally a zone you shouldn't of touched and said it lightly that you can just report to authorities. It's very ignorant of you to do that sir. You say you aren't dumb enough to get hacked, but you probably don't understand how easy it is for a l33t hacker to GET information from you. I've had a friend who's a computer techie get constant DDOSed in his challenger games in EUW because some l33t hacker decided to have funsies. So again, you don't know what it's like to get hacked either. This OP clearly said she took as many precautions as possible in getting rid of said stalker, but failed to do so because it's SO easy to get hacked. I don't even know what kind of proof you want. The hacking was unexpected as she said, she was caught off guard and can't offer more than some of the few things she has. What kind of proof do you want her to have? a live video of the man talking how he RUINED that girl's account? like what lol.

1941;1178; Quote: 5526e10cf34308c2: Read my other posts, I have little belief that someone would hack into your Router and replicate your IP address, which is a federal crime, without having done more than just combining your runes and delete your friends. Also it does not say that in the TOS that its ok to share your account in any way, shape, or form, for EloBoosting or not, it says ALL account sharing is not allowed, you broke the TOS, Riot technically has no obligations to support you or even give you back your runes. if you don't think that is possible then stfu lol. all you need is a rat or team viewer and you can pretty much access about anything with the same ip as the person you hacked. A simple keylogger and RAT and then bingo your victim has no proof

You broke the contract you made with the game, it doesn't matter if its to let your friend play some ARAMs or not, you broke the rules, you deserve to pay the price for it, nothing you say can justify you for breaking the law. 
1941;1211; Quote: 2315eab6dabe4510: You literally half-read everything you reply to. This was a reply to someone saying that it would literally BOTHER them just to be in a game with me because a friend used my account to play a few ARAM's. It's not about me breaking the TOS, which I completely and honestly admitted to riot from the start, they didn't even have to question me about it. They didn't find it and bring it up and then I came clean, I told them from square one. This is about someone caring so much about something that doesn't effect them at all. this is about you whining and crying just like you did in the gd tourney you screwed up yet again now shut up and pay the price idiot 
1941;1258; Quote: 6e3c07ddc7165d30: Ahhh. Another one of these threads. I always feel inclined to agree with the victim and not believe the whole riot has no reason to lie or target you Though after numerous cases, Riot is always right and the victim ends up being in the wrong. Either Riot is reading too much into the account sharing which has nothing to do with the actual hacking or the OP is lieing out of her ass. I'm on the fence atm. The OP is lying out of her ass. I like how the hacker conveniently decided to talk to her on skype and allow her to record him so she could have evidence. Now she's saying something about a sexual assault. I didn't follow the whole thread but, don't you think you would be a bit more inclined to have something done about being sexually assaulted before yelling at Rito for not returning your LoL account back to you? I would imagine if you were sexually assaulted, playing LoL would be the last thing on your mind, not the first. Hey OP, how about you post pics of the police report you supposedly filed? 
1941;1283;ITT, OP shares account. OP gets bit in the ass for it. OP blames Rito OP is a fgt.
1941;1293; Quote: 2315eab6dabe4510: I have said since the beginning that the person sexually harassed me. they openly bragged about hacking me and ****ing with my account because I refused to give them a cam show.I wouldn't post any information on here regarding contacting the police, because that is negative to a case. Tampering with evidence if you will. IF the person who has bragged to myself and others about hacking me is reading this thread and I was like YO I SUBMITTED A POLICE REPORT, HERE IT IS he could easily take steps to remove evidence that the police might otherwise be able to obtain. this isn't about proving myself to you guys, it's about protecting my own safety. Don't ask me to put my own safety at risk just so you can see a piece of paper and judge me more about/for it. Bull****. Are you a compulsive liar in person too, or just on the internet? I'm done with this now. I'm not going to call you what I want to call you on the .01% miracle that you're telling the truth but, if you're really lying about being sexually assaulted to get some runes back in LoL, you're pretty much sub-human. Trivializing people who have been really sexually assaulted is one of the lowest things a person can do and to do it over something so petty... I just can't even fathom it.Goodbye.

You could be classified as just as bad as her if she were lying. Assuming she's lying and then calling her sub-human because of it (seriously, what if she isn't lying? Really take into account the things you are ****ing saying man..) pretty much marks you as a complete jerk.Her story is pretty darn believable if you were to ask me, like seriously what else does she have to do to prove all of this? I had a similar experience to hers a bit ago so I can see where she's coming from though.I can't even bring myself to fathom all of the hate in this community sometimes.

1941;1345; Quote: 5526e10cf34308c2: You do realize that she blatantly admitted to breaking the TOS by sharing her account? After that happens, she has no credibility or can make a case by saying that she has been hacked because after that who knows what the person she shared with could have done with the information? I highly doubt, HIGHLY DOUBT, that if someone did hack into her router and remotely accessed her computer that all they would do is just screw up her rune pages and delete her friends on League of Legends, it sounds so unrealistic because they could have and should have taken personal information from her computer as well and done many things with it, but instead its just her League of Legends game that got hit by an isolated hack? I have little to no belief that someone would go through all of that trouble of committing a federal crime of hacking internet routers to just screw up someone's game. NO WAY SHE LET SOMEONE ON HER ACCOUNT AND THEN MONTHS LATER SHE GETS HACKED [ BY NOT THE PERSON WHO WAS ALLOWED TO USE IT] BUT BECAUSE SHE LET SOMEONE USE HER ACCOUNT SHE CAN'T GET SUPPORT Do you realize how dumb you and everyone else sharing this ToS violation, therefore no support view sounds like

This is the internet and nobody gives a **** THAT much about pulling someones strings in this manner on a video game. There are more valuable things to hack then some 15 year old girls computer. Extortion LOL. You think that this girl has valuable **** on that PC? Hackers would much rather spend their time hacking a PC or a company that will help them financially. There is nothing to gain from messing up someones runes. Oh wait you are right extortion, he gained so much from ruining runes. Damn people now know the secrets to becoming filthy rich, hack LoL players and mess up their runes! If this guy had really hacked that pc then I doubt riot would have ignored her request and i doubt she would have been able to keep that account with just messed up runes. Like i said I don't believe you people understand the amount of work that needs to be put into hacking an account. Tell you something, messing up runes isn't one. If this was in fact for extortion that account would have been gone and sold with runes in tact.

And quite frankly I can't imagine you gaining much respect from most men in real life with your ****, ass, whinny attitude. Most guys will run as fast as possible to the opposite direction just to avoid girls like you. So stop the bull **** with oh men hurrass me all the time, blah, blah, blah! shinanigans cause it's getting old. On top of this you make it seem like there has never been a case where a girl claims some dude raped her and hurrassed her for the benefit of gaining money. The amount of times ive heard this on the news I can't even keep count. This story doesn't add up and even riot made a post about how she was lying about specific posts then you want US to believe everything she is telling? I'm sorry cupcake but we aren't all that guillable and if you want to take in every bit of information any person feeds you then that is fine but don't hang people and play the victim roll for making a logical judgment call.

I mean, you can pick whatever side you want, that's your right and I don't really care either way. But you can't argue that I have no proof when Riot hasn't given you anything at all, and I've at least /tried/. You were the one saying Riot's support is terrible and wanted to get special treatment publicly. But hey it's not like you did anything wrong, right? It's totally not like you should be begging for Rito's forgiveness and mercy instead of being a cockmongler, OP.
