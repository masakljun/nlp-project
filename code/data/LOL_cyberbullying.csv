          you people all make me sick. He did nothing wrong to deserve it. 
          Everyone just targets him because they don't like him even if he 
          doesn't do anything wrong now. Why don't you sad nerds go find 
          something to do with your lives other than talk **** about someone 
          that doesn't even affect your guys' lives? Oh wait you don't have

          durr fd897c3091b5bee1 fanboy&quot; no not really. I've seen his stream a 
          couple of times, that's about it, and i'd defend anyone in his 
          position if the same thing were to happen because this thread and 
          you people are full of ****. You all disgust me.<br><br>Gd is like

          Tbh, fd897c3091b5bee1 really is a ****ter, but this whole hate 
          circlejerk is really not necessary. Personally, when I see someone 
          acting like they have autism, I prefer to ignore them, not make a 
          thread about it.

You&Acirc;ve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on what&Acirc;s going on, since we haven&Acirc;t spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. <br /> <br /> In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. We&Acirc;ve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While we&Acirc;ve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. <br /> <br /> While we can&Acirc;t share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks.<br /> <br /> We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to. <br /> <br /> -Ryan</p>","2014-08-21 00:00:00"

   <b>For months now,</b> some players have been using DDoS style attacks to take down individual games, players and servers to avoid losing games. Whilst this affects a small percentage of total games, it has impacted a lot of players, and it's something we'd like to minimize as much as possible.

<br /> Yes, those were isolated individual incidents where a single game or a single person was impacted. So they posted in that regard.

          Yes, those were isolated individual incidents where a single game or 
          a single person was impacted. So they posted in that regard.<br><br>This

          For months now, some players have been using DDoS style attacks to 
          take down <b>individual games, players <u>and servers</u> to avoid 
          losing games.</b> Whilst this affects a small percentage of total 
          games, it has impacted a lot of players, and it's something we'd 
          like to minimize as much as possible.

    Not sure where you've been, but this has been impacting the servers too 
    for months now. Maybe it wasn't everyday, but I sure as hell remember when 
    the entire servers would go down and someone's twitter was linked on the 
    forums saying they caused it. This is not new and it's been an annoyance 
    for MONTHS<br><br>Sigh. I don't even care anymore. I'm just disappointed

    Hey Everyone, 
   <br /> Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. You&Acirc;ve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on what&Acirc;s going on, since we haven&Acirc;t spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. We&Acirc;ve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While we&Acirc;ve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> While we can&Acirc;t share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to. 
   <br />

  </div> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<br /> 
<br /> So this is different than the DDOS sticky you have had for the last 6 months.. 
<br /> 
<br /> I updated the game. 
<br /> 
<br /> Glad I didn't actually play it. 
<br />

<br /> 
<br /> To put this into prespective, 
<br /> 
<br /> World of Warcraft is also experiencing the same ddos attack issues as we are currently. 
<br /> 
<br /> Think about it. WOW, which has been up for years, which requires you to pay in order to play their game, still to this day experiences attacks. 
<br /> 
<br /> Its not something you can solve in months, or even years. Its the infrastructure that is already set in place that is inherently flawed and Riot can't do anything about it. 
<br /> 
<br /> And if you ask why other places are not attacked, and it seems like its just league, just remember, these people are doing it because they think its fun to rustle the jimmies of such a large online community like League of Legends, because it will cause the most reactions online than most other communities. Reading our reactions and our anger and our protests makes them feel good because they have nothing better to do. They like reading the outrage online, while they post on their twitter proudly.

Or the constant clipping the game seems to have now. Or the constant 120 ping (used to be 90 a season ago). Just because your lucky doesn't mean it doesnt exist.

<br /> New servers aren't going to prevent a DDOS attack. That would only give the attackers a new target. 
<br /> 
<br /> Also, as Ryan said, DDOS attacks are an arms race. As defenses get better, so do attacks, and new methods of attacks are developed just as the old ones are defended against. It's a never ending game of cat and mouse.

    New servers aren't going to prevent a DDOS attack. That would only give the attackers a new target. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Also, as Ryan said, DDOS attacks are an arms race. As defenses get better, so do attacks, and new methods of attacks are developed just as the old ones are defended against. It's a never ending game of cat and mouse.

          So just to clarify for everyone, the attacks referred to in the 
          stickied post by 5e67716a07f4200d are a very different issue. Those 
          are the drop hack attacks that have been impacting individual 
          servers and games. What we're posting about here are the issues 
          we've been having over the last week or so have been much larger and 
          have impacted almost every player on the game when the attacks occur.<br><br>While 
          we've been able to take steps to improve the drophack issue, these 
          new sets off DDOS's that have been impacting us require different 
          tactics.

<br /> No one sensible believes them. DDoS attacks are a fact of life. They happen. But you take steps to mitigate the issue. Of course that requires you to spend money on better infrastructure. That includes having multiple locations for servers, redundancy, ISPs that have real DDoS prevention, etc. If your business partners can't do their job, you kick their ass to the curb and get someone who can.

<br /> Valve doesn't have this many problems and they have a fraction of the resources. Riot is a Tencent company. They can afford infrastructure that rivals Google/Facebook with ease.

<br /> You're a ****ing idiot. That would be because it's the single most popular game in the world. That makes it the best target.

<br /> 
<br /> Do you realize how much data 200-400 gbps is? Most connection speeds are in the range of 10-40mbps. That's a difference of about 10000x. Imagine that's all being written to your computer's hard drive. That 1tb hard disk you have is filled theoretically, in under 3s, and that's assuming you can even write that fast or your cpu can process data that fast (it can't). This is a massive amount of trash data on a scale you can't comprehend, and this issue is far bigger than riot. This issue is a result of poor infrastructure, a lack of good ways to persecute the people behind the attacks, and the fact that all of that information being sent still has to be filtered out at some point without ****ing your in game ping. All of that processing takes time, and the ddos attacks significantly increase the traffic on the network to the point where having enough processing power to handle peak hours several times over doesn't cut it.

I'm just saying let's pretend there's 10 million people on in peak hours and they have capacity for 15 million, if they purchased servers to accommodate 50 million people (or rather more data), would it do anything?

          We are sorry for the ongoing server issues in many parts of the 
          world including very recent North America and Europe problems. Lots 
          of work has been done to help improve things and more work is still 
          being done.<br><br>We have seen significant increases in hackers 
          running distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) ( <span><font color="#257372">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack</font></span>) 
          against game and platform servers. League of Legends has not been 
          the only target, most large game companies have been feeling the 
          pain along with other online businesses, but we have been a more 
          frequent target than most. In the last 6 months over half of all 
          DDoS attacks we have seen against LoL have been in the last 2 
          months. We are currently seeing 2 to 4 attacks every day against one 
          or more regions. The strength of these attacks has increased 
          significantly over the last few months as the arms race against 
          hackers continues to grow in scale.<br><br>League of Legends is made 
          up of dozens of components, some of these are easier to protect 
          against DDoS than others. Typically websites are easiest to protect, 
          while game servers are hardest (most standard forms of protection 
          would create lag in game like League of Legends).<br><br>In the last 
          2 weeks world record breaking DDoS attacks ( <span><font color="#257372">http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks-and-breaches/ddos-attack-hits-400-gbit-s-breaks-record/d/d-id/1113787</font></span>) 
          have been seen by several companies including Riot. These attacks 
          are so big that the ISPs and Telecom's that service League of 
          Legends have not been able to keep their Internet circuits up while 
          the attack is underway. This means that our servers often do not 
          even see or feel the malicious traffic itself because the Internet 
          connections feeding our data centers are being cut off due to the 
          size of the attacks filling the very large Internet circuits the 
          telecoms and ISPs have.<br><br>When our data centers lose the 
          Internet, your connections to game servers and/or PVP.net services 
          like Chat and Login get disconnected in the worst case or lots of 
          players will see serious in-game lag for the duration of the attack. 
          If lots of players get disconnected, you will often see a login 
          queue to get back into PVP.net or the game.<br><br>We expect the 
          current attacks to get better soon. We already have been able to 
          fend off many problems before they create problems for you. Our 
          network team has been working almost non-stop for several weeks both 
          fighting off DDoS attacks around the world and strengthening our 
          Internet services. We have also been working with telecoms and ISPs 
          to help them understand how to block these attacks so that their 
          services are not affected. Some fixes have required new equipment 
          and ISP circuits to be ordered which can take weeks to get shipped 
          and installed. Some telecoms and ISPs are slower than others in 
          applying the fixes needed to ensure they do not fall over from these 
          attacks, we depend on many ISPs so its important that all ISPs make 
          the fix or the bad traffic finds a way to knock off our servers.<br><br>Of 
          course this is an arms race so as one defense gets put in place, 
          eventually we can expect new methods to launch attacks that will 
          often require time to put a defense in place. About half of the 
          equipment investment in League of Legends is network gear with a 
          large part of that in place to just handle the ongoing rise in 
          frequency and size of DDoS attacks. We are investing even more every 
          day around the world and will continue to work hard to win the 
          fight. We are also working closely with our equipment providers and 
          other services to make sure we are doing everything we can to 
          protect the many components that make up League of Legends.<br><br>Sometimes 
          we lose the fight and that sucks because it means players like you 
          feel the pain too. It also means that instead of our engineers 
          building cool stuff for players we have to fight off bad stuff from 
          hackers, so players lose again. It's frustrating, but the reality of 
          large scale Internet services, so we have to get smarter and better 
          to make sure players around the world can have fun when you want to 
          have fun.<br><br>I apologize for the pain and promise that we will 
          continue to get better. New data centers with stronger and even more 
          Internet connections are getting close to being live for Europe and 
          North American players, with all other regions scheduled for 
          complete overhauls as 2014 goes on. These new data centers will help 
          us keep up the fight in the hacker arms race, they won't solve all 
          the problems we deal with all the time, but they should level up our 
          side of the fight a great deal.<br><br>In the meantime we are not 
          helpless, teams are still working long hours, expect daily 
          improvement.<br><br>See you on the Fields of Justice,<br><br>d560eb18682e36cc<br>VP 
          of Network Operations<br>Riot Games<br><br>P.S. for the more 
          technically curious here is some background reading on the current

          Work has been underway on NA for many months. We need to get EUW on 
          our new architecture and make sure we have it baked into our

          ping time for NA East Coast players. Cool things coming.

          We have several connections to the Internet going to the NA game 
          server pool, so a DDoS does not always kick all players off our 
          network and some will see various levels of lag while some will see 
          nothing (though might still have their game ruined as other players 
          in at are impacted).<br><br>Work is being done to try to improve the 
          system that manages ranked games and loss forgiven. We have smart 
          teams who are focused on improving the experience of players who get 
          hammered when bad things happen to the network or servers. It's 
          complex and tricky to nail the balance on this, think about all the 
          players who may have completed a game with no issue and won, they 
          are not going to be happy if we roll back that win (and depending on 
          the luck of the draw that win could be yours while someone else is 
          getting the bad end of an DDoS attack or when we make a mistake in 
          our data centers).<br><br>Not impossible to improve on this, but it 
          takes time, lots of angst here at Riot on figuring out how to make 
          this as fair as possible.

          We are in agreement that we have been slow to get messaging out on 
          this, the team has come up with a new process that includes a forum 
          post by the system admin or network admin who responds to an issue 
          for every live service fix. Hold us accountable, we are going to get 
          better at this.

          Moving servers more central for all NA players is a priority. As I 
          mentioned earlier, truck loads of servers are purchased, we just 
          need to lock down the data center contract and get the Internet 
          circuits installed. In the meantime the servers near Portland, OR 
          will see connection improvement for many players as the direct 
          connections to the major ISPs and telcos get installed (more are 
          getting hooked up every week). We were maxed out of quality space, 
          Internet bandwidth, and power in the Los Angeles area so Oregon was 
          the best choice at the time to get large amounts of servers up and 
          running (Facebook, Apple and a few other major players are an easy 
          drive away), it is technically only 7-9 msec further away from the 
          LA area (if LA was the better place, it is not for all players) but 
          we need to optimize the routing and circuit mix to really achieve 
          the best possible connection for all players to the Oregon located 
          servers. The team is working long hours to get this done.<br><br>In 
          the last few months many players were likely getting first routed to 
          LA then to Portland through San Jose or sometime weirdly through 
          Seattle. Now lots of players are taking a much more direct route to 
          just San Jose and then Portland if you are not in the Southwest USA 
          or you will likely pass through Seattle then to Portland if you are 
          in the Northwest USA or coming out of most of Canada. So ping time 
          for many players should have gone down in the last month (but not 
          for all). This will continue to optimize for more players as we get 
          more telcos and ISPs directly connected.<br><br>Another team is 
          focused on getting game servers spun up more centrally which will 
          then allow Oregon to become the fall back site if things go into the 
          ditch in a bad way (something we have not had as option in the 
          past). So net, Oregon is a temporary hop which has allowed us to 
          significantly expand the number of game servers and other resources 
          we have needed to help stabilize NA. Next step is to optimize ping 
          time for as many players as we can in Oregon and then a more central 
          to NA location which we will tell you about as soon as we lock it 
          down.<br><br>-d560eb18682e36cc

    There are ones available for game servers as well including Staminus and Intreppid which cater to game servers.

<br /> These services may be successful for other games, but there's one thing you have to take into consideration. Any time you add a DDoS protection to a network, you have to consider the implications of doing so. 
<br /> 
<br /> We're already in the process of adding multiple different levels of protection, but each step of the way, we have to ensure that we've accurately tested these services. If we didn't test them thoroughly, we could shoot ourselves in the foot before we even start protecting our servers. One large problem we've seen is once we turn on mitigation, latency increases by a large amount. With this latency increase you have essentially taken down the service yourself. 
<br /> 
<br /> Another thing that I've mentioned in previous threads is that when you have such large attacks against your network, you have to work with many different ISPs/groups to ensure traffic is being properly blocked. I can't give too much detail, but this is something we're always actively doing, as well as making network changes to give us more control over our network service as a whole. 
<br /> 
<br /> If there are any specific questions, I'll do my best to answer them, but remember, one of the reasons we can't share a lot about what we're doing is because it's always a game of cat and mouse. We don't want to show our hands about our defense, just as much as the attackers don't want to share too much about their attacks.

<br /> I would usually be right there with you, but we're seeing the kind of attacks US military bases see to try and hijack satellites to steal weapons and combat strategy information...if you watch the attacks live it's pretty intense, 
<br /> 
<br /> yes they should have more money into servers...but when you compare say WoW to this, they have been running a lot longer, and people didn't have as fast of internet back when WoW was 4 years old, either way, Riot will hopefully grow the quality of the servers and have more backups and it will get better

<br /> That's an interesting vulnerability, but it's not really specific to only DDoSing Amazon related services. Essentially people left an exploitable service open to the Internet instead of properly firewalling it off, and then attackers were using those pwnd Amazon instances to DDoS other things on the Internet.

I guess that was what it was right from the start. What I *am* surprised by is how these attacks have been around forever and no one defends against them from the get go. You would think getting setup with servers now a days would have something out of the box for this. Regardless of how, or why, the fact there is quite a bit of money exchanging hands with 16 million subscribers, even on a pay to play system (At last read, ESPECIALLY on a pay to play system, meaning they often make more than a subscription based game). And yet, where is all that money when it comes to additional servers needed elsewhere, mirrors servers? backups? defenses against this. Perhaps taking a cue from other large game companies in both network security, remediation and financial responsibility when it comes to infrastructure? Its bad form.</p>","2014-08-21 00:00:00"

    That's an interesting vulnerability, but it's not really specific to only DDoSing Amazon related services. Essentially people left an exploitable service open to the Internet instead of properly firewalling it off, and then attackers were using those pwnd Amazon instances to DDoS other things on the Internet. 
  </div> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<br /> 
<br /> What I'm saying is that the affected amazonaws servers you allow through your FW are the ones causing the destruction going unchallenged because they are whitelisted. 
<br /> 
<br /> Lizardsquad's Ion cannon botnet derives from that exploit, you need to start blacklisting internal traffic or move on to another provider, I have run TCP stream analysis with a network protocol analyzer and there are no signs of external IP's causing the overflow, it all comes from your own allowed servers, amazonaws shows, your ping server and 2 more IP's, everytime amazonaws pops on the stream when your ping server attempts to SYN, the game takes a dump.

    Hey Everyone, 
   <br /> Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. You&Acirc;ve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on what&Acirc;s going on, since we haven&Acirc;t spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. We&Acirc;ve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While we&Acirc;ve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> While we can&Acirc;t share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> -Ryan 
  </div> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<br /> 
<br /> Isnt this the same bs you told us a few months ago when the servers were getting DDOS'd everyday? This is inexcusable. Its been half a year and you've been making no progress, at all.

    East Coast or Central servers won't help this particular type of attack. These are pipefilling attacks that cut off the ability for services to talk to one another. The location of our servers has very little impact on the ability to execute that type of attack. 
  </div> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<br /> 
<br /> I'm pretty sure the request for East/Central servers is so that we can actually have a 
<i><b>reasonable</b></i> ping during 
<b><i>normal</i></b> play. When I started playing League about 2 years ago, my ping rarely went over 80. Now, my ping is regularly at 100+, with frequent jumps to around 200 and sometimes higher, up to 4-500. 
<b><i><u>This has persisted over three different ISPs and doesn't happen in any other game.</u></i></b> This is very obviously a problem with

<br /> How can I possibly have fun when

1891,174,2e7851d9d58589a0,"<p>As with the post above I have huge complaints over latency issues. I am not saying East Coast servers would stop the DDOS problems, but a normal game for me should not become a competition of who has a better connection.<br /> <br /> In addition I want to say I am unhappy about Riot handling DDOS. I have not had a loss forgiven in the past three days, and have dropped down because of it. All the games lost were because me or a member of my team could not play. In one game three different people on my team dced; the enemy team was perfectly fine. I just finished a game where I had 500 ping and dced twice. Before people start saying it's a problem on my end, I had 3 normal games before this that all went smoothly with no latency issues. I was home alone and the only one connected to my internet. The problem was on Riot's end, and like the rest of my games over the past three days, there was no loss forgivness.</p>","2014-08-22 00:00:00"

<br /> Alright something that has come to my attention aswell and im pretty sure what the cause is. Back before the DDOS attack started i ran around 80 ping my self now i sit around 101-105+spikes I believe the cause is the security software they have been implementing to reduce the effects of the DDOS attacks. They say many times that YES there is technology that they COULD use to reduce the effectiveness of the attacks but it will also increase the latency across the board (wich is why i believe alot of us have gained around 20 latency it is the time it is taking the software to proccess and authenticate our data) any NOC Rioters want to confirm my suspicions here I would much appreciate it and believe the community would aswell.

<br /> The LCS is on a different server. Often times even a different patch wall gardened off locally to prevent these kinds of things... The problem is that you cannot do this for internet based games like League so your ire is misplaced. 
<br /> 
<br /> While it's true that even Riot admitted that there are additional measures they /can/ take it comes at a cost. By making these changes the latency may increase as it has over time more and more. I started playing the game at 50ping on the east coast and now I'm lucky to get 130. 
<br /> 
<br /> People doing this because 'they can' or because 'companies aren't protecting you' is actually a form of extortion. While they may not directly benefit who is to say that security companies and code writers are not benefiting from this kind of attack? Many hackers often get hired by big security firms to help test and improve networks because they are able to do what they do. Either way it's illegal and should stop. The people doing this are criminals pure and simple. Their raison d'etre is simply to cause chaos because it gives them joy. The reason they give as why they do it is just a mask of nobility to protect their fragile egos.

There greed will be their down fall. They got way to big, way to fast, and can't keep up with the demands of a game that has become so popular. I work at Xbox's labs in Redmond, if this were ever to happen to us at work, everyone one of us would get a very bad review. This would lead to the loss of our jobs, but then again Microsoft will throw money at the problem to fix it.

So much in fact you take our money, obviously can't even get decent programmers, security, much less can't even barely have a forum to help anyone at all other than yourself. Have spent hundreds of dollars on this game thinking you would somehow be a fair company. You have massive problems, attacks, knowing your servers barely work, yet still i just got banned for your system that is flawed and screwing me over. Yet since you have some stupid ass tribunal program that doesn't care(much like you) as to what the basis was before giving a penalty or ban. If you cared about *the players* like you say stop bending us over and taking a home run. Then say &quot;o man i know it's frustrating that we take your money but that doesn't mean we will have a tech support other than automatic responses because were stuck in 1995. Hell you don't even have a support number where you can actually talk to a person rather than having 0 help. You say the last 24 hours the attacks started then why has the last 2 weeks been having this same exact problem? Hmm? Maybe you can't admit that anything is ever your fault because then you might actually have to do some work and use some money to better you franchise. But hey &quot;**** the players&quot;? Not like your problems losing me all my rank back down to ****ing bronze now i am banned because of you **** servers, programmers, and ability to see that you are punishing players for your constant **** ups. Truly thinking about going to small claims court for my money back i wasted supporting you and stopping playing this game since the players you love o so much and care about are more likely to catch a meteor to the nuts than get any real help or understanding from you.

They don't charge for service and we just pay for skins once and for new champs ONCE (unless you use IP then nothing at all). I'm not saying they can't do better, what I'm saying is that I think they don't have access to resources that multi-billion corporations do such as Microsoft and Sony, who by the way charge you more for their content and services.<br /> <br /> Second of all, I'm sure these attacks are real. It has happened to people before. The Pentagon got hacked several times before and even NASA, Universities too. These punks go around F'ing up our day just like the trolls we experience in game but on a more damaging scale. We need to weed out, find, and put away these little punks so that we can finally game in peace. If you know a hacker, give them up to the authorities! Odds are they are not doing anything honorable with their knowledge when they could be helping prevent such heinous breaches of security and to our gaming time.<br /> <br /> To Riot: If you do believe you need help with this or could use it, why not ask your customers? Create a donation fund for your community in an attempt to raise money that will solely go into cyber security and finally get ahead in this cyber arms race. Perhaps reach out for players who have cyber security experience and see if they could donate some time to help?

1891,249,c5b3b5fcc2e3e5eb,"<p>EDIT: Uninstalling/Re-installing overnight seems to have fixed things. I will leave the original message below for others having this issue. <br /> <br /> My game was fine earlier tonight, but about an hour ago I tried to play a custom game with friends. I picked a champion, then could not connect to the actual game. I keep getting stuck there, unable to connect to a game. Tried it in 2 games with them which ended up turning our custom 3v3 into a 2v3. <br /> <br /> Repaired the game then decided to try again. I tried to do a custom game, but I couldn't even make one. Got a message like &quot;Due to a high number of games, you cannot make a new one now&quot; or something. That made sense considering how bad the servers are right now, but I still wanted to see if repairing the game had fixed things. I didn't want to put more people into a 2v3 or a 4v5 and my friends had started a new game while I repaired, so I started a Co-Op vs AI game. I felt bad about possibly putting others into a 4v5, but it was Beginner Bots, so I didn't feel too guilty. We all got stuck in champ select, but things seemed to be going okay. Then I got the same Error. <br /> <br /> These are the messages I'm getting. <br /> <a href="/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=1055126"> 1055126</a><br /> <a href="/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=1055125"> 1055125</a> <br /> <br /> I don't <i>really</i> want to mess around with my firewall, especially since things worked fine earlier tonight.

1891,250,32f33acbc2542ed7,"<p>When a company such as Riot get DDOSed, the attack is very rarely done by a single person. Most people do not have the resources to produce enough data packets to affect servers like the ones used for league. The problem with &quot;fixing&quot; the issue Riot is currently faced with is that most decent hackers can cover their tracks making it difficult to determine the source of the data packets and in order to hit the large servers Riot use there are going to be large number of attackers.<br /> <br /> The only way to fix the current server issues would be to find and take the attackers out of the picture through the slow and annoying American legal system or to buy servers with better protection. Riot will not buy new servers, but they will sue the individuals responsible for all the profits they are gonna lose.<br /> <br /> No matter how stupidly expensive League of Legends can be we have to realize it is a free to play game and Riot will lose less money keeping the servers up until they deal with the servers than they would buying new servers.<br /> <br /> Hackers hack for two main reasons: money and if something is personal. League has pissed off a load of eight year olds, but realistically it's more likely that some one is getting paid. Give it two weeks the problems should be sorted out, and Riot will come out like the big hero but most likely the hackers will have finished their contract and move on to some other project.<br /> <br /> Long story short be patient the servers will go back to being meh soon enough. You probably shouldn't play ranked until it is so if you're not happy with your position play in the morning servers seem to work best around noon.</p>","2014-08-24 00:00:00"

1891,260,c0d5a3713eadf406,"<p>Just an idea for some devs. Have an app wrapped around your login portal. Try to handle logins through this app, basically, the idea is to use a boolean operator to switch a dos off your portal. Once you do that, you can send the high volume attacks to a VM where a database just picking up ip addresses. Once you have the ips, you can just hard code block them via that table with the ips. So, if someone is attacking your server, you can just route them out. If you're running the website off the same server, I would go ahead and invest in a single server. Only problem would be a large queue could possibly fire off that same trigger. I'm not sure what angle they are hitting you from, but just an idea for you guys. Anyway, just a thought, I'm sure you all have it already handled though. I'm sorry about the attacks. It's a pain to deal with when your servers are constantly getting hit.

   <br /> I hated the idea that I would have to access a third-party network in order to play this game, but I figured I'd try it for a week and would cancel if it didn't work. It affects a lot of the other games I play, so I don't mind paying a little for it, but League is the only game that absolutely requires it in order for me to have a fair playing field with my opponents. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> As proof of how much it helps, here is a screenshot I got of my connection over a period of about 2.5 hours earlier tonight. 
   <br /> 
   <a href="/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=1055751"> 1055751</a> 
   <br /> The most shocking part of it is the fact that with my normal connection, I'd have a Packet Loss count of 483. That is insane, and no other game affects me that badly. I know that Riot's server is getting attacked right now, and I don't blame them for that, but even under normal circumstances, their NA server is not great. I'm putting this info here so that more people can be helped by it.

<br /> Here's the population for NA: 528.7 million (as of 2008) 
<br /> 
<br /> I imagine we have far more people playing on our servers than they do on theirs and they get 
<b><i>TWO</i></b> servers to split the load across their country. Oh wait, that's right. We get LAN where I can't even speak the language or read it to be able to make an account so I can play with a decent ping with people I won't be able to communicate with. Silly me.

    Hey Everyone, 
   <br /> Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. You&Acirc;ve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on what&Acirc;s going on, since we haven&Acirc;t spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. We&Acirc;ve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While we&Acirc;ve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> While we can&Acirc;t share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to. 
   <br />

<br /> happened to me today and I solved it. 
<br /> 
<br /> go to the league folder (usually C:/Riot Games/League of Legends) 
<br /> 
<br /> go to the RADS folder then PROJECTS, then delete the folders &quot;lol_launcher&quot; and &quot;lol_patcher&quot;... after that, run League of legends (pref as an administrator) 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> the game should atomatically refresh those folders and fix the launcher problem. (the patcher should downlad again, but then I had to fo a Repair from the Launcher main page -top right cog icon-) 
<br /> 
<br /> hope it helps.

<br /> Exaclty how I feel about this. I don't even remember how much money I've spent on this game this year alone, only to time and time again arrive from work and realize that I can't even enjoy my purchase to its full extent due to constant server related issues! Please invest more time and effort into a stable playing environment! flashy skins and particles simply don't charm me enough to keep me craving to play...

Look all i'm saying is be part of the solution and not help make it a worse problem by trying to MAKE them compensate you when you could just spend your time doing something else or something productive.

<br /> Exactly! You people chose to donate your money to the game. Riot has no obligation to make you happy. Because tomorrow when the game is fixed, i guarantee you will be back. And riot since then would not have lifted a finger. And the world keep spinning as nothing ever happened.

<br /> Ah see my friend this is where you are false. They do what they can. I get emails, updates and apologies. Which is more than i really EVER got with Blizzard. They are a free to play game but they try to reach out to their summoners here. I love this game and the Rioters that I have met and played with and cannot wait to meet and play with more of them. I just want to be able to play

1891,442,10dd98b69b14ca56,"<p>My only complaint, is that I don't play League very often. I'll get on for a few hours every so often to play this game. Luckily I haven't had a lot of issues with DC's, until today. The one day I decide to get a skin for a champion. I got to play a bot game just to have fun (that's all they are really for), and I get DC'd. Ok well whats my problem? Everyone's getting that? My Problem is the fact that Riot despite having all these issues, launches a brand new launcher. What does it do? absolutely nothing. All it is, is an additional screen and function we have just to get on the game. So if you want to play these days, you have to click the icon, click launch on the first launcher, then on the second launcher enter your information and click launch again, which now prompts you to wait about 5 minutes at times to be logged in because of the server issues, to finally get onto the game main screen. Instead of making a fancy new add-on screen like all other companies are doing that doesn't do anything, why not focus more effort to make the servers more stable? I don't care about the new champs or new skins but why make a whole added step to just trying to play a game when you know that people are already going through an added step that's caused by server issues? <br /> Just a thought, next time you want to apply a new system that doesn't really enhance the experience...make sure that people can just enjoy the game unhindered. We won't notice it that much and you won't be the target of bad press. But that's none of my business *sips tea*</p>","2014-08-30 00:00:00"

<br /> Ok so we agree mostly but as i see it it isn't donations.. But as you said they have to pay for their employees and such... where do you think our skin money goes? Paying employees... and research. I'm not a dumb woman I just hate all the people bashing a free to play game that when it isn't down is actually very good. I apologize for biting back but people have been attacking my opinion all day wanting things just given to them.

    Yeap, all games have this problem. The difference is how fast they solve 
    and how proactive they are. Take this example, Tibia experienced a lot of 
    attacks. Nowadays, if it happens, they take a day to fix it or even less. 
    If the issue persists, they offer a benefit for the players. Tibia runs 
    like League of Legends, free to play with special features for people that 
    are willing to pay.<br><br>Riot is a big target and so far, they are not 
    trying to change anything. They just act when they are attacked. If they 
    keep doing this behaviour, sooner or later people will get tired and will 
    move to different platforms or games, such as DOTA 2.<br><br>I have never 
    attacked YOU, I was talking about your option and how it lacks support. It 
    doesn't mean that I think that you are dumb or a sh.ithead. I just think

    Lol and then servers go down in the middle of a game. Sure it's nice that there's &quot;Loss prevented&quot; in ranked..But let's be real here, I didn't lose LP ok fine, but who the **** cares. This game is becoming such a waste of time. Get on to play a game for fun, just to find out its lagging and everyone is d/cing.

Some bad eggs do crappy stuff ruining things for everyone else because they are angry or the hate whoever they are attacking, but at the same time they are bothering innocents who just want to play and have fun and they can't because someone else is too busy screwing up their game time. This road only leads to things getting harder for everyone else instead of helping things get better if this is what they had in mind. This same road also causes more restrictions on stuff to be made. Things may be taken away. Costs may raise. They don't think about this when they do these things. All they care about are themselves and their agenda. Screw whoever else is involved apparently. Probably a bunch of lil whine-bags who got perma-banned for something in the first place.

That's when our rammus reconnected! I waited for him until he reached the enemy nexus and we had a dance party after i last-shot the enemy nexus.

<br /> You're wrong though, and i bolded the parts i wanted to touch on. 
<br /> 
<br /> We Don't get our in game items, as the servers wont allow us to play with them. It's also not just about &quot;oh we've spend 5-10$ here or there&quot; some people have been playing this game for a while and invested money in to this company. That's what dedicated players who spend money are- Investors. We have create revenue for Riot, and in turn the supply us with a game we can play. When we have invested several hundred dollars in to this game over the course of a few years (about 4 in my case)we expect something in return- a game that works. People asking for some sort of monetary compensation aren't asking for every champ to be unlocked and free skins for a life time- they just want Riot to give a little back to the people who have given to them. So when the servers are down on a day that many of us have off, we can't help but to be frustrated. Yes, they have us as consumers, but what incentive do we have to keep supplying them with publicity/money when they can't keep the main aspect active? 
<br /> 
<br /> We're a consumer public. If you don't care about your public you don't last long.

How about you actually FIX the issues instead of saying you've resolved them only for them to arise again 2 days later and persist for several days beyond that. If you guys were a hotel you'd be rated 1 star at best, because instead of caring about people actually ENJOYING the experience, all you people care about is UP-SELLING champs and skin to make more profit on a game that doesn't work 60% of the time. To be frank, I don't give a rat's ass if I'm being ill-mannered, I'm saying what the majority of the community has been thinking for a long time, and in a way that MIGHT actually reflect the level of frustration we feel every day with your product. Keep putting a half-ass effort into your pathetic servers and I guarantee you another game is going to come along, take your clients and put an end to this pitiful charade.</p>","2014-08-30 00:00:00"

I've spent at least 300 dollars on RP and wont buy any more till you fix your game. I know finding the people doing this is complicated, but dude that 300+ dollars is a lot of money and i cant see my skins when i like cause of this bs. Sugar rush is even here and i want annie in wonderland but i will stick to my guns.

    You are horribly wrong, a lot of big gaming corporations have invested money into upgrading their equipment to match with the quality of other competitors and to stay current with technology, Microsoft, Blizzard, Valve, Twitch, Youtube, Google, and others still spend money on improvements, Riot Games is not poor enough to upgrade, they are just trying to see how long they can milk us until everyone folds.

<br /> Seriously. Letting people on the servers just gives them the illusion that they can play, and makes them 10x angrier when there are problems. 
<br /> 
<br /> Riot, if defending against DDOS is an arms race, maybe you should, I don't know, put some more arms in that race. Otherwise, it makes you either 1. look like you have no idea what you're talking about or 2. not being upfront with your playerbase about what's really going on. Neither of which are good PR. 
<br /> 
<br /> Honesty is the least you could do for your customers, especially the ones who paying.

<br /> see most companies who cared about their customers would do what they could to make them happier. riot on the other hand just wants money and doesn't care what happens to its customers. this is why in a few years riot will be a curbside company. most companies would also pay compensation for their neglect to certain things I know many games who give out free stuff because of a screw up on their end. one of them being Trion. take a hint from the riot. I promise it will keep people from quitting this horrible server ridden game.

    These services may be successful for other games, but there's one thing you have to take into consideration. Any time you add a DDoS protection to a network, you have to consider the implications of doing so. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> We're already in the process of adding multiple different levels of protection, but each step of the way, we have to ensure that we've accurately tested these services. If we didn't test them thoroughly, we could shoot ourselves in the foot before we even start protecting our servers. One large problem we've seen is once we turn on mitigation, latency increases by a large amount. With this latency increase you have essentially taken down the service yourself. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Another thing that I've mentioned in previous threads is that when you have such large attacks against your network, you have to work with many different ISPs/groups to ensure traffic is being properly blocked. I can't give too much detail, but this is something we're always actively doing, as well as making network changes to give us more control over our network service as a whole. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> If there are any specific questions, I'll do my best to answer them, but remember, one of the reasons we can't share a lot about what we're doing is because it's always a game of cat and mouse. We don't want to show our hands about our defense, just as much as the attackers don't want to share too much about their attacks. 
  </div> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<br /> 
<br /> Would latency be a problem if there were both west and east coast servers? :\ 
<br /> 
<br /> Why won't you guys split NA? I mean, what's the reason if it's not money? Then you can use DDoS protection because the latency is already down, right?

    rofl as a paying customer I have the RIGHT to say what I want if you have a problem with that just ignore what I say. no one asked you for your input I am pretty sure you haven't really spent any money on this game because you are a noobie or you don't have the extra cash to do so. either that or you still live with your parents and don't have a job.

<br /> You talk about horrible ethics but you're the one talking **** and being unprofessional; just complaining and complaining on their forums. If you really don't like Riot or no longer supports them with what they're doing, then stop paying them. If you do hike do rugby bike or whatever the **** you do, then go do those while you wait for the game to reach its normal condition... Be patient.

You're the one being rude here to Riot and I am simply defending them because I am grateful that get to play an amazing game that I got for free, eventhough it has some flaws to it.

<br /> 
<br /> LCS Games are held on private servers that are not public on LAN, it is essentially impossible to DDOS a server that is not accessible by any computer, our servers are public so any computer can access it, DDOS Attacks have a lot of different ways of denying service, but the gist of it is that either bots simulate a bunch of computers or a lot of user computers get ridden with viruses and then they request an obscene amount of information from the servers and it just blows it all up because servers have a very hard time distinguishing from what is a phantom computer from a real one, especially when hundreds of millions of requests happen all at once. 
<br /> 
<br /> Lizard Squad is a mystery to us all, some people think they are just claiming the DDOS Attacks and hacks but not actually doing it. I feel like they might be a scapegoat from the real terrorists and people will waste time finding them instead of the real guys because they are not the real threat. Also they haven't announced DDOS Attacking our servers in a very long time either, despite the many many many times we all get DCD and the servers blew up because supposedly the FBI caught a few of their goons (but we don't know the real truth either).

One last proposition if there is so much more than is needed for both projects, maybe you could create a third access point in the mid-west or south region of the US, and if there is still excess maybe the top 100 donators get up to $100 in riot points, next 100 gets up to $50, then the next 100 get up to $25, and everyone else who donates gets $10 in riot points. All of this benefit for both parties should make it more worth your while to help fix these issues with latency from attacks and from distance from the main server.</p>","2014-09-02 00:00:00"

          people on the east coast can have resolved latency issues, since the 
          population of the New England region of the US is so high and have 
          more than enough people to make it worth you while.<br><br>This is 
          just an idea, I'm pretty sure there are better ways to go about it, 
          however I have seen that money is one issue involved. One last 
          proposition if there is so much more than is needed for both 
          projects, maybe you could create a third access point in the 
          mid-west or south region of the US, and if there is still excess 
          maybe the top 100 donators get up to $100 in riot points, next 100 
          gets up to $50, then the next 100 get up to $25, and everyone else 
          who donates gets $10 in riot points. All of this benefit for both 
          parties should make it more worth your while to help fix these 
          issues with latency from attacks and from distance from the main 
          server.

<br /> Not just East coast. I'm in Texas. Lag is terrible here. Best part is, that my friends and family play the game with me. When one lags, we all lag. Absolutely fantastic when the other team doesn't lag at all. Then they spam you with bullcrap about being better.

<br /> I had these issues a very long time ago. Maybe more than a year ago. It was impossible to play the game. Basically I stopped playing but after a while I came back and the problems were not there anymore. It sorta fixed itself. It's hard to pin point the cause of these issues but it's safe to say it's not from my end since I could use everything else just fine. All other online games ran perfectly. Only league is stuck with these stupid connectivity and lag problems. The client is one of the worst I've seen in any game ever. ****ty indie Mobas have better clients for their games. 
<br /> 
<br /> Right now I'm having issues at the start of games (not all games about 1/5 of the time ). Basically for the first 5-10 minutes I keep freezing and disconnecting for about 5 seconds before coming back to normal. These are very frequent. After that the lag magically stops and the ping is back to normal. I can then go back to playing the game (if there's even a point to that since by now the enemy already has a decent lead). There is the occasional lag spike here and there but it's really nothing like the beginning of the game. I can play normal games forever but as soon as I jump into ranked these ****ing issues come back. 
<br /> 
<br /> Very frustrating experience.

1891,801,36a439db13fbf0d4,"<p>Riot refuses to acknowledge a problem because they never acknowledge when they are the cause of an issue. Go back and look. Riot has blamed everything except themselves for the problems they are having. I'm not talking the DDOS issues because well, they don't control that. I'm talking the inferior gaming experience they provide. They have blamed firewalls, comcast, Time Warner Cable, ATT, &lt;insert random ISP here&gt;. <br /> <br /> The one constant through all of this is Riot. For some reason I see this as the same thing that has happened to almost every game that blows up like LoL did. The lag gets horrendous until they upgrade their servers and other hardware. It happened in Everquest and WoW to name two. It's happening in League as well. The difference is the companies who made those two games admitted the problem and fixed it in a reasonable amount of time.<br /> <br /> Until Riot fixes it on their end expect this to continue to happen.

<br /> I don't think that's completely true. They do make a lot of money, but so do many big companies who also deal with hacker groups on a daily basis. Things like these just aren't easy, no matter how much capital you have backing you. League has a massive amount of players, the most in the world for an online game. Dealing with DDOS's and the like is difficult and not something completely preventable, especially since LoL is such a large target.

1891,847,5307710b000ca2d6,"<p>I don't mind Riot having problems with hackers/DDOS/etc but they need to figure out a better system than &quot;loss prevented&quot; that **** doesn't mean anything in normals. Some people come on to play a game and get their WOTD then this **** happens throwing the game into the blender on what team wins. If the servers are affected that badly during a game, all members should get a &quot;Win Granted&quot;.</p>","2014-09-04 00:00:00"

But still, this is very frustrating, a lot of us spent nice sums of money on this game (in the good ol' days when it was actually working). Even though some refund and such would be nice, I understand why that wouldn't be possible, LoL has the largest community in the world, you can't refund that much people... IP boost are just useless and meanningless for seasoned players like me.<br /> <br /> As for the issue at hand, I understand that DDoS are hard to control, but by the time it began, I would think that with their funds and staff they would ahve found some sort of solution by now, surely there is a way to fight these attacks efficiently. You know we ARE talking about lonely kids wasting time in their basement...<br /> <br /> Would still be nice to have some sort of follow-up, maybe what they are doing to stop the attacks, that would be retarded, but at least just something that tells us where close they think they are.</p>","2014-09-04 00:00:00"

<br /> Did you found a multimillion dollar company? 
<br /> Did you get a bachelors/masters/phD in networking or programming or any other computer related degree?

<br /> Really? Well, I'm 41 years old. I make more than enough to spend a few thousand on this game and not worry about it. I play because I enjoy the game. However, I do expect a certain return on investment. Just because I can afford to do whatever I want, does not mean that I don't want good customer service. In the last year, I have eclipsed the $5000.00 mark. I pay for my 3 boys and their friends to play. Champions, boosts, skins, etc... About 12 accounts in all. For the haters, I am not saying I deserve more than anyone else, I am saying that this is supposed to be the new meta in E-sports. I work my ass off for what I have. I have certain responsibilities at work, that if not upheld, I would get fired. Our customers accept no excuses. Nor, do I. Riot is a billion dollar company. This is not some private server. It is a business. Maybe it's time for you to realize that and stop flaming people that are pissed. They have an investment in this game, whether time, money, or both. So..please STFU and mind your own business

    LCS Games are held on private servers that are not public on LAN, it is essentially impossible to DDOS a server that is not accessible by any computer, our servers are public so any computer can access it, DDOS Attacks have a lot of different ways of denying service, but the gist of it is that either bots simulate a bunch of computers or a lot of user computers get ridden with viruses and then they request an obscene amount of information from the servers and it just blows it all up because servers have a very hard time distinguishing from what is a phantom computer from a real one, especially when hundreds of millions of requests happen all at once. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> Lizard Squad is a mystery to us all, some people think they are just claiming the DDOS Attacks and hacks but not actually doing it. I feel like they might be a scapegoat from the real terrorists and people will waste time finding them instead of the real guys because they are not the real threat. Also they haven't announced DDOS Attacking our servers in a very long time either, despite the many many many times we all get DCD and the servers blew up because supposedly the FBI caught a few of their goons (but we don't know the real truth either).

    Hey Everyone, 
   <br /> Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. You&Acirc;ve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on what&Acirc;s going on, since we haven&Acirc;t spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. We&Acirc;ve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While we&Acirc;ve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> While we can&Acirc;t share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to. 
   <br /> 
   <br /> -Ryan

<br /> It's been two weeks since this sticky was made. There are companies that you can pay for DDOS protection. RIOT has the money to mitigate this, they just don't want to spend it because it would cut into their profits.

1891,932,746ba8a6d264cf42,"<p>meh they won't do **** they are busy with their LCS and gnar to fix real issues like server stability their loss prevention bs is not even fast enough to reconcile games which are being affected. when my team is winning and there is lag its turned on.<br /> when we lose due to dc's and lag its not turned on fast enough.<br /> <br /> Riot is the new blizzard, ego's and $ over customer service only difference is blizz has a 10yr headstart and they've lost over 6 million subs in the past 3 years<br /> if you guys don't wise up ur company will be another failed experience.<br /> <br /> you can't be crying DDOS for a whole month.<br /> its pathetic for a B-illion dollar company PATHETIC.</p>","2014-09-06 00:00:00"

1891,935,51d8ddbdacfc9bc2,"<p>this game is unplayable in NA, ever ygame now is server lag and disconnecting, i cant tell you how many ranked game ive lost to this bs. multi-million dollar company cmon riot spend some money on stable servers ffs</p>","2014-09-06 00:00:00"
1891,936,c37a365cf6a1fcf7,"<p>I just lost 21 LP because of server lag.. Thanks rito!I want my lose prevented or I think I'm out!<br /> It's hard enough managing to keep my cool with all the children, baddies, and trolls, but then to add unplayable lag... I imagine there's a sizable chunk of people who are in the same mindset right now.</p>","2014-09-06 00:00:00"

1891,938,f3f5dd797938bdd4,"<p>To this date we in the NA server have been dropped from ranked and team builder matches. This may sound harsh but we are lossing interest in the game due to this . Please deal with it as fast as you are able . Thank You</p>","2014-09-06 00:00:00"

1891,941,4b257d857fc03039,"<p>Um, Riot is not Blizzard; the producer of popular titles such as World of Warcraft and Diablo has consistent revenue in the form of subscriptions. It really does make a huge difference in terms of available monies to make changes where they see fit. And what makes you think Riot isn't actually trying to find a long term solution, as they have indicated so many times. I don't like the disruption of service as much as you do, but it seems really pigheaded to just say &quot;Riot, you suck&quot;. instead of waiting out a solution.</p>","2014-09-06 00:00:00"
1891,942,330a5049c33b116f,"<p>Still have crappy connections. Don't always get loss prevented. /Fail</p>","2014-09-06 00:00:00"
1891,943,dc52c66c9ad7b9a2,"<p>So I've gone through yet another promotion loss and would like to understand why loss prevention isn't on while these attacks take place. I would love to be able to take a break from ranked until the issues can be resolved, but seeing as that results in your rank dropping I don't view it as an option. I just lost another promotion because myself and two teammates kept getting &quot;attempting to reconnect&quot; errors and would constantly dc. However this was not happening to the rival team. I understand that Riot is having issues. But they either need to keep loss prevention on or remove whatever it is that's causing people to drop in rank when they go without playing ranked for a while. This infuriates not only myself but I'm sure many others that are running into this same issue.</p>","2014-09-06 00:00:00"

1891,945,c70d140d9c1de39f,"<p>It hurts so much that I cannot enjoy this game anymore over the past several weeks. Always getting the &quot;Attempting to reconnect&quot; thing. I really hope it will be resolved soon but as some have expressed here, it's time to take a break from League of Legends until the issue has subsided because it's just plain unplayable.</p>","2014-09-06 00:00:00"
1891,946,148db0a990b0984f,"<p>I see alot of players, more so the casual ones, heading to Dota2 or HoN. Thats a significant loss of revenue to Riot due to the instability of the servers. I mean, im sure the die hard LoL players will ***** and the &gt;gold will continue to support the game. I hope they find a solution soon.</p>","2014-09-06 00:00:00"
